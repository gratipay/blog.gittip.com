&lt;p&gt;With this name change, we are also retiring our Tumblr blog, in favor of a Medium Collection. Follow the &lt;a href="https://medium.com/gratipay-blog"&gt;Gratipay Blog&lt;/a&gt; collection, and read our name change announcement over there: &lt;a href="https://medium.com/gratipay-blog/gratitude-gratipay-ef24ad5e41f9"&gt;Gratitude? Gratipay.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks! :-)&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://blog.gittip.com/post/96092973886</link><guid>http://blog.gittip.com/post/96092973886</guid><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2014 12:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>We Depend on Voluntary Payments</title><description>&lt;p&gt;In “&lt;a href="https://medium.com/building-gittip/gittip-year-two-a220308d4ec9"&gt;Gittip, Year Two&lt;/a&gt;,” I concluded that Gittip works, but not yet for Gittip. We know that it’s possible to use Gittip to make a sustainable living. We know that Gittip can enable amazing work. The question is, can we sustain Gittip itself through voluntary payments from our users? Can we fund Gittip on Gittip? So far the answer is, “No.” Gittip makes about &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/Gittip/"&gt;$470 per week&lt;/a&gt;, which is about $2,000 per month, or $24,000 per year. We are not a sustainable business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia is the best example of an organization that successfully funds itself by asking its users to voluntarily pay for the service, through their familiar annual fundraiser. Taking a cue from them, we’ve added a Wikipedia-style appeal to Gittip. Here’s what it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/18993416e4d059c18862241f2a29df69/tumblr_inline_nadat1Ldw01rn81gb.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We show this message to active users of Gittip who don’t give to Gittip. You won’t see it otherwise. The specific dollar amounts are scoped to your usage of the platform; our suggestions are also reflected on our new &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/about/pricing"&gt;Pricing&lt;/a&gt; page. Feel free to choose a different amount, or to opt out if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope to encourage active users to pay for using Gittip, so that we can survive and thrive as an open company. If we can figure out the formula for ourselves, then we can help other &lt;a href="http://www.opencompany.org/"&gt;open companies&lt;/a&gt; building &lt;a href="http://thechangelog.com/open-products/"&gt;open products&lt;/a&gt; to be funded along the same lines. Eventually, we want Gittip to be a place you can go to find a whole range of open companies to work for and make a living from. Our mission is to enable an economy based on gratitude, generosity, and love, where we all share our work and wealth and lives with each other voluntarily and abundantly. From what I can tell so far, it&amp;#8217;s really fun! :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will you &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/Gittip/"&gt;help us&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

We call this &amp;#8220;payday.&amp;#8221; It&amp;#8217;s really the core of Gittip, and the process hasn&amp;#8217;t been substantially refactored since we launched over two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past two months we&amp;#8217;ve been working on a &lt;a href="https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues/2508"&gt;rewrite&lt;/a&gt; of the payday algorithm that addresses a number of under-the-hood issues. Payday is now safer and faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most visible user-facing change is that now, if you&amp;#8217;re both giving and receiving money on Gittip, we&amp;#8217;ll only charge your credit card for the difference. Before, we were charging you the whole amount of your gifts even if you were also receiving money, which was confusing and also wasted money in credit card fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been a significant engineering effort for our team, which is still very much in the bootstrapping phase. In fact, we think of ourselves as &amp;#8220;double-bootstrapping,&amp;#8221; since we&amp;#8217;re trying to &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/Gittip/"&gt;fund ourselves&lt;/a&gt; on the very platform we&amp;#8217;re building. In particular I&amp;#8217;d like to thank &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/Changaco/"&gt;Changaco&lt;/a&gt; for all of his hard work on this payday rewrite and many other parts of Gittip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now would be a good time to double-check your &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/about/me/history/"&gt;history page&lt;/a&gt; on Gittip. If you see something wrong or confusing, please let us know either privately by emailing &lt;a href="mailto:support@gittip.com"&gt;support@gittip.com&lt;/a&gt;, or publicly on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Gittip"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues/new"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for using Gittip!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chad Whitacre is the founder of Gittip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://blog.gittip.com/post/94752151641</link><guid>http://blog.gittip.com/post/94752151641</guid><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2014 16:19:52 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>Farewell, Homepage Leaderboards</title><description>&lt;p&gt;When I launched Gittip over two years ago, one of my goals for the homepage was to quickly answer the question, &amp;#8220;Does Gittip actually work? Is anyone making any money here?&amp;#8221; I decided to add a leaderboard showing the top receivers on the site so anyone could see for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within weeks it became apparent that the leaderboards were going to be &lt;a href="https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues/64"&gt;contentious&lt;/a&gt;, and indeed they have been over the years. Gittip is about collaboration, but the leaderboards on the homepage lent the site an air of competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, we launched a new homepage. It&amp;#8217;s a much simpler introduction to Gittip, with a straightforward call to action: Sign in to accept payments! For those who aren&amp;#8217;t ready to sign in, we provide a link to our About pages as a secondary call to action, and other potentially interesting pointers in the fine print. Once you&amp;#8217;re signed in, the homepage shows a simple &amp;#8220;Welcome back!&amp;#8221; and a link to your profile. In the future we&amp;#8217;ll be making the homepage &lt;a href="https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues/2584"&gt;more dynamic&lt;/a&gt; for signed-in users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community pages still have leaderboards for now, but we&amp;#8217;re planning to remove them from there as well. We have conversations going about what &lt;a href="https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues/634#issuecomment-13677898"&gt;behaviors&lt;/a&gt; we want to encourage on Gittip, and how to use the community pages &lt;a href="https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues/967"&gt;to do that&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#8217;re also talking about how to provide value for companies that have been using their place on the Gittip homepage as a form of &lt;a href="https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues/1513"&gt;advertising&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does Gittip actually work? &lt;a href="https://medium.com/building-gittip/gittip-year-two-a220308d4ec9"&gt;Yes&lt;/a&gt;. With this new homepage we&amp;#8217;re hoping to provide a cleaner impression for people finding us for the first time&lt;span&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;without the air of competition. &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/"&gt;Go check it out&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://blog.gittip.com/post/92534876471</link><guid>http://blog.gittip.com/post/92534876471</guid><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2014 10:38:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>Errors in Team Distributions Last Week</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Gittip&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/about/teams/"&gt;Teams&lt;/a&gt; feature enables the distribution of funds each week among members of a team. During last week&amp;#8217;s payday, two bugs in the algorithm for distributing team funds led to overpayments to 55 members across 21 teams, totaling $141.34. Most of this was for the Gittip and Aspen teams: $124.56 (88%) to 13 members (62%). Additionally, funds (less than $2) were not distributed at all to eight members across three teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The payday algorithm runs in three loops: payin, pachinko, and payout. Pachinko is where the team distribution happens. Payday crashed twice during the pachinko loop due to bugs in the pachinko algorithm. After the second crash, we decided to skip the pachinko loop entirely and proceed directly to the payout loop. We took this decision on the understanding that the dollar amounts involved with teams is relatively small, so the risk of needing to do a major correction was low, and we were under time pressure to submit payouts for the day to our processor, Balanced Payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since most of the money involved in the error was for the Gittip and Aspen teams and the effect on other teams was so small, we decided to let the overpayments stand. This amounts to an extra payment from the teams in question to their members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For further details please see &lt;a href="https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues/2362"&gt;this GitHub issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the error. If you have any questions or concerns, please get in touch on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Gittip"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#gittip"&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="mailto:support@gittip.com"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://blog.gittip.com/post/85747015891</link><guid>http://blog.gittip.com/post/85747015891</guid><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2014 16:04:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>Harassment and Openness</title><description>&lt;p&gt;One of Gittip&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://building.gittip.com/big-picture/brand/"&gt;core values&lt;/a&gt; is a love of self-critique, so as we watch the story unfold of Julie Ann Horvath&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/15/julie-ann-horvath-describes-sexism-and-intimidation-behind-her-github-exit/"&gt;harassment&lt;/a&gt; while at GitHub, we thought it an appropriate response to &lt;a href="https://botbot.me/freenode/gittip/msg/13785409/"&gt;ask ourselves&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;#8220;In what ways is Gittip at risk of enabling harassment?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are an &lt;a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/26350459746/the-first-open-company"&gt;open company&lt;/a&gt;, which for us means that we share as much as possible, charge as little as possible, and fund ourselves openly on Gittip itself. In fact, our purpose in helping drive the &lt;a href="http://www.opencompany.org/"&gt;open company movement&lt;/a&gt; is precisely to address the root causes of social ills such as harassment. GitHub&amp;#8217;s fall from grace is so sad because it&amp;#8217;s so predictable: it&amp;#8217;s simply too easy for harassment to fester behind closed doors. Open the doors! Fresh air! Fresh air! Many eyes make bugs shallow, both in code and in culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking personally as someone who ticks all the standard boxes of privilege (straight white male, etc.), knowing that my conversations and interactions are public helps me pay more attention to what I&amp;#8217;m saying and doing. Why do I want to pay attention to my words and behavior? Not, I hope, out of fear of reprisal (whether in court or on social media). I want to avoid bullying and harassing others out of love. I want my avoidance of harassment to be a byproduct of my pursuit of positive relationships with everyone I interact with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But open companies, like open source, are not magic pixie dust. One lesson we&amp;#8217;re taking away from GitHub is that a flat organizational structure has challenges. There may be no clear path or authority figure to go to for conflict resolution. Combined with &amp;#8220;hidden structure&amp;#8221; (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxRWW4CYLSI#t=13m38s"&gt;re: Valve&lt;/a&gt;), the lack of conflict resolution pathways especially hurts those most in need, those without power. Of course, traditional HR departments have their own issues. Ideally they are an objective third party to resolve conflict, but to the cynic they exist to limit the company&amp;#8217;s exposure to lawsuits. GitHub&amp;#8217;s most recent statement &lt;a href="http://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/legalese/"&gt;suggests this approach&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub is a fantastic and inspiring product, and we heavily depend on it in building Gittip. We pay GitHub $25 a month, mostly because we believe in paying for the products and services we use (we do use private repos as part of our security issue workflow). We haven&amp;#8217;t yet used a purchasing decision as activism, and it&amp;#8217;s not obvious to us that this is the time to start. For now, we&amp;#8217;re keeping our repos at GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this story unfolds, we&amp;#8217;ll keep asking ourselves whether we need to vote with our dollars, and as we grow as a company we&amp;#8217;ll &lt;a href="https://botbot.me/freenode/gittip/msg/13829048/"&gt;keep an eye out&lt;/a&gt; for policies Gittip needs in order to resolve conflict early, and to properly handle harassment when it comes to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;

On January 3, 2013, we moved $1,425. Using that as the base, here&amp;#8217;s what doubling means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;$1,425&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$1,425 x 2 = $2,850&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$2,850 x 2 = $5,700&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$5,700 x 2 = $11,400&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we moved $11,683. That means our dollar volume has doubled three times in a little over a year. Here are the actual numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Week 31 - January 3, 2013 - $1,425&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Week 49 - March 9, 2013 - $2,882&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Week 66 - September 5, 2013 - $5,769&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Week 89 - February 13, 2014 - $11,683&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our number of active users is growing slower than our dollar volume. This makes sense because we have more companies giving on Gittip than we did a year ago, and they are generally able to give more than individuals. For example, &lt;a href="https://blog.andyet.com/2013/11/27/happy-thanksgiving"&gt;&amp;amp;yet announced a program&lt;/a&gt; in November (they&amp;#8217;re currently our top giver), and &lt;a href="https://blog.engineyard.com/2014/gittip-open-source-grant"&gt;Engine Yard stepped forward&lt;/a&gt; this past week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/about/charts.html"&gt;our charts page&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/ec995690e37a97cdb486ce9312f25c2d/tumblr_inline_n0ye10N20s1rn81gb.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We mark time from week 31 because that&amp;#8217;s when our founder, Chad Whitacre, started working on Gittip full-time and &lt;a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/39687487576/gittip-is-hiring"&gt;building a team&lt;/a&gt; in earnest. You can see that growth was relatively stagnant prior to then, except for an initial burst, and a small bump that turned out to be &lt;a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/35314128322/the-delpan-incident"&gt;fraud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took 18 weeks for our dollar volume to double once, 17 weeks to double again, and 23 weeks to double the third time. We chalk up the slight slowdown in growth to the fact that we released no user-facing updates to the site in the fourth quarter of 2013. Instead, we focused on technical infrastructure and team-building. Our &lt;a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/74460469599/with-first-retreat-gittip-team-becomes-a-reality"&gt;Company Retreat in early January&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated the success of our team-building efforts, and marked a return to user-facing changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the retreat, we&amp;#8217;ve released the following user-facing improvements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ability to connect an OpenStreetMap account, to provide a free-as-in-speech sign-in option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to connect a Venmo account, to facilitate one-time, out-of-band gifts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to list a bitcoin address, to facilitate one-time, out-of-band gifts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dropped the 150 minimum threshold for Communities, to make it easier to find people you know on Gittip. Currently the &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/for/perl/"&gt;Perl community&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/peter_rabbitson/2014/02/i-bought-a-weekly-round-for-my-friends.html"&gt;discovering&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://shadow.cat/blog/mark-keating/2014/04-gittip/"&gt;Gittip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve also improved our customer support system, as well as continuing to improve our developer experience. We&amp;#8217;ve soft-launched &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TQATN7-IxphyguJzEqxgo-99hJYavdOObNYNlVoX0us/edit"&gt;a major redesign project&lt;/a&gt; to engage the design community in Gittip and build a truly world-class, user-friendly product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, we&amp;#8217;re doubling our volume every four or five months. If we continue at this rate, we&amp;#8217;ll hit $22,800 by June or July, and we should pass $100,000 per week sometime in the spring of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for using Gittip, and stay tuned! :-)&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://blog.gittip.com/post/76555013500</link><guid>http://blog.gittip.com/post/76555013500</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2014 15:25:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><title>Forty-one Accounts Involved in Security Leak</title><description>&lt;p&gt;On February 4, 2014, we leaked security tokens for the Venmo accounts of 41 Gittip users, which an attacker could have used to steal money.

Exactly one year later, 20 participants in our &lt;a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/26350459746/the-first-open-company"&gt;open company&lt;/a&gt; gathered together in person for the first ever Gittip company retreat. One participant travelled from the Czech Republic, and another from Trinidad. The rest were from Canada and throughout the United States. Only seven were from the Pittsburgh area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/efc98feb07ff59212642c1d191d5bce1/tumblr_inline_mzxx1lA6901rn81gb.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Row 1&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(left to right)&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Christopher Clarke, P.J. Jimenez, Joe Esposito, Nik Markwell. &lt;strong&gt;Row 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Zbyněk Winkler, Christy Leonardo, Carl Levinson, Bruce Adams, Luke Strickland. &lt;strong&gt;Row 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Chad Whitacre, Jocelyn Graf, Lyndy Palmer, Sean Linsley. &lt;strong&gt;Row 4:&lt;/strong&gt; Heidi Gardner, Oscar Sanchez, John Rubino. &lt;strong&gt;Not pictured:&lt;/strong&gt; Pat Connolly, Aaron Lloyd, Angel Vagias, Kim Zick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeting around a dining room table in Ambridge, Pennsylvania, the first item on our agenda was to review Gittip&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/for/contributors/mission-statement.html"&gt;Mission and Vision Statements&lt;/a&gt;, and our Product Overview. Our Mission and Vision are broad statements of our reason for existing, and speak to a goal much larger than day-to-day operations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gittip&amp;#8217;s mission is to redeem the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We envision a future in which the economy is characterized by trust, collaboration, cooperation, sharing, openness, transparency, care for one another, inclusion, inspiration, purpose, generosity, patience, empathy, optimism, and love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Product Overview became the document we spent the most time refining. It is incorporated into the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TQATN7-IxphyguJzEqxgo-99hJYavdOObNYNlVoX0us/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;2014 redesign project plan&lt;/a&gt; that we&amp;#8217;re now developing in the wake of the retreat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We agreed to order these aspects of the website to reflect their level of importance: Giving, Profiles, Teams, and Communities. This led to a decision to prioritize our work together where all of our tasks are evaluated based on their relationship to Giving and the ease with which a participant is able to give, especially for the first time. This distillation and focus generated assent and enthusiasm among the team members present and helped us through more arduous tasks, like agreeing on a system for prioritizing our GitHub issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday&amp;#8217;s conversations gave way to hacking on Saturday night and throughout Sunday and into the following week. One team went through all 450+ issues in our issue tracker, prioritizing all of them according to the scheme we came up with together. Another team started thinking through the onboarding flow for new givers. A third team worked on the onboarding flow for new developers via Vagrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important work of the retreat, however, was in cementing relationships amongst the team. Here we succeeded mightily. Participants were reluctant to leave: by Wednesday we still had five folks hanging out and hacking!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday&amp;#8217;s sessions were video-taped and posted to YouTube. These videos don&amp;#8217;t begin to capture the full collegial spirit of the retreat, yet we post them here in the interest of openness:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next year&amp;#8217;s retreat is scheduled for January 2-5, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Here is &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiDJ5uiG6Hp3dFVudEJMeHBGYnk2SGtVbzladGNGOHc&amp;amp;usp=sharing"&gt;a report on the finances&lt;/a&gt; for the retreat:&lt;/p&gt;

Communities allow individuals to identify with large groups of people that share common interests, such as &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/for/python/"&gt;programming languages&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/for/korea/"&gt;geographical regions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/for/korea/"&gt;Korea&lt;/a&gt; community group was the first to surpass the 150-member threshold to become a viable Community, but other groups have since surpassed it in membership numbers. Viable communities have formed around &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/for/javascript/"&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/for/python/"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/for/open-source/"&gt;other tech interests&lt;/a&gt; and projects around the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communities have shown us that they&amp;#8217;re more than just a number of people with common interests, though. Three months ago, the Drupal Community &lt;a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/61497419514/drupal-co-maintainer-funded-at-475-wk"&gt;rallied&lt;/a&gt; to help a major Drupal contributor meet a significant weekly income goal. Community support is integral to the survival of projects like this. Without it, overhead costs like bandwidth and hosting become cost prohibitive and a significant financial burden to the project. Without financial support, many projects like this would not be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In fact, a user who joins a community on Gittip is three times as likely to be an active user of Gittip than one who doesn&amp;#8217;t. Because it&amp;#8217;s clear that this feature makes Gittip more useful, we look forward to finding ways of adding even more value to the community experience on Gittip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently 18 fully active communities on Gittip. Communities with fewer than 150 members are still considered in the formation stage, but many are growing quickly. As of December 2013, there are about 700 Communities still in the formation stage, so there is literally something for everybody. &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/for/"&gt;Browse the list&lt;/a&gt;. You&amp;#8217;re likely to find an interest you share with others.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://blog.gittip.com/post/70621940685</link><guid>http://blog.gittip.com/post/70621940685</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Dec 2013 17:16:08 -0500</pubDate></item><item><title>Call with David Heinemeier Hansson</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Gittip founder Chad Whitacre participated in an open call with 37signals partner and Ruby on Rails founder David Heinemeier Hansson today. The call came about after David wrote a blog post three weeks ago, &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2013/the-perils-of-mixing-open-source-and-money.html"&gt;The perils of mixing open source and money&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#8221; When he was subsequently &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Bruce_Adams/status/400381703648473088"&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; to Gittip, it kicked off a lengthy Twitter conversation that resulted in a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/building-gittip/2c621dbd7541"&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; from Chad, followed by an &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/400760704803672064"&gt;invitation&lt;/a&gt; from David &amp;#8220;to have a longer discussion about this in person at some point.&amp;#8221; Thomas Fuchs &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thomasfuchs/status/403880839995740161"&gt;kicked off&lt;/a&gt; another round of conversation 10 days ago, followed by a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/whit537/status/407627022685319168"&gt;third round&lt;/a&gt; yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic topic of the conversation is how crowdfunding affects open-source. Open-source (like &lt;a href="https://medium.com/building-gittip/7c266abbe54"&gt;journalism&lt;/a&gt;) has achieved a delicate balance, where the parties involved know what the rules are, where the money stops and the open-source love (or the journalistic integrity) begins. This boundary is messy at times, but it&amp;#8217;s been more or less thoroughly explored and is well-understood by those involved. Crowdfunding upsets this stasis. Does crowdfunding corrupt open-source by introducing extrinsic motivation? Does it crowd out the intrinsic motivation that lies at the heart of open-source?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the video of the call:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/p1E-svVd9Xc" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://blog.gittip.com/post/68909962126</link><guid>http://blog.gittip.com/post/68909962126</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Dec 2013 16:34:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><title>Help Hazel Fight Trafficking</title><description>&lt;p&gt;We received the following in email from a friend of Gittip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to let you know about a very special account now on Gittip: &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/Hazel_Mae12/"&gt;https://www.gittip.com/Hazel_Mae12/&lt;/a&gt;. Hazel is our god-daughter. After having been trafficked as a minor by a violent man, beaten, held against her will, she found the courage in her heart and the allies (from the U.S. Attorney&amp;#8217;s office) to escape and stand up to him in court and see him put in jail for 30 years. California Rep. Juan Vargas has since introduced the Child Protection Act of 2013, named &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th/house-bill/1690"&gt;Hazel&amp;#8217;s Law&lt;/a&gt;" after her, which would ensure that traffickers do not receive lighter sentences merely by claiming they did not know the victim was a minor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://media.tumblr.com/058b71fdb80e69ca1c65c9b758b674f3/tumblr_inline_mvdybe1Jnf1rn81gb.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now 21 years old, and still recuperating from her years of trauma, she is taking her story to those who will listen, speaking to lawyers, social workers, law enforcement, schoolteachers, and governmental bodies about ways they can recognize girls in sex slavery and assist these victims in escaping &amp;#8220;the life&amp;#8221;, rather than blaming them as the problem. She receives little pay for this, so I have encouraged her to open a Gittip account where those who hear her story (and might not otherwise have a vehicle for assisting her and her work) can easily help her on a continuing basis to fight the good fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funding open source work is important and rewarding for givers and receivers. But Hazel&amp;#8217;s work is on a level of importance above that, in my opinion. If part of your vision for Gittip is to support communities outside the software industry, I ask that you consider promoting Hazel&amp;#8217;s account as an example of what we can do together when we look to ourselves for support, rather than corporations and governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We couldn&amp;#8217;t be more honored to have Hazel Mae on Gittip. Please consider &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/Hazel_Mae12/"&gt;supporting her work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://blog.gittip.com/post/64956662443</link><guid>http://blog.gittip.com/post/64956662443</guid><pubDate>Thu, 24 Oct 2013 10:33:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>The Community is My Cofounder</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m applying to Y Combinator with Gittip. One of the main pieces of feedback I&amp;#8217;ve gotten on my &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/whit537/6723103"&gt;application&lt;/a&gt; is that I should find another founder. As Warren Konkel of Bountysource advised:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t think of it as &amp;#8220;I need a cofounder to get to the YC interview,&amp;#8221; and instead, &amp;#8220;Gittip will be a much stronger company if i have a cofounder, and YC invests in strong companies.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m empathetic to this. I&amp;#8217;ve had two past experiences with business partners. The first worked out great: we had a good run, and parted amicably. The second time I ruined an old friendship, so I understand both the benefits and the risks of having a cofounder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the YC application deadline approaches, I&amp;#8217;ve been &lt;a href="https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues/1603"&gt;exploring&lt;/a&gt; the possibility of adding a cofounder to my application. For better or for worse, no slam-dunk choice has emerged from amongst the Gittip community. Therefore, I&amp;#8217;ve decided to move forward with the YC application on the basis that the community as a whole is my cofounder. For most companies, this would be bullshit. For Gittip, I propose that it&amp;#8217;s actually true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the ways that the Gittip community fulfills the cofounder role:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The community boosts my morale.&lt;/strong&gt; Of course there&amp;#8217;s the collaboration in IRC and GitHub, and the financial generosity on Gittip itself. But I also get to witness inspiring acts such as one contributor &lt;a href="https://botbot.me/freenode/gittip/msg/6925801/"&gt;mailing a laptop&lt;/a&gt; to another contributor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The community corrects my bad decisions.&lt;/strong&gt; The most vehement example of this was the &lt;a href="https://botbot.me/freenode/gittip/msg/6118740/"&gt;pushback&lt;/a&gt; I got on a dumb idea I called &amp;#8220;issue tracker zero&amp;#8221; (don&amp;#8217;t ask!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The community feels a real sense of ownership.&lt;/strong&gt; Our issue tracker is full of epic tickets with impassioned (yet respectful) debates, involving scores of participants, e.g.: &lt;a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues/5" title="allow for one-off tips"&gt;#5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues/14" title="pay in with bitcoin"&gt;#14&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues/28" title="switch to opt-in"&gt;#28&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues/126" title="find a solution for withdrawals outside the US"&gt;#126&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues/138" title="change the  name from gittip to something else"&gt;#138&lt;/a&gt;. I mean, heck, the &lt;a href="https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues/1404"&gt;YC application ticket&lt;/a&gt; itself has two dozen participants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The community gets work done.&lt;/strong&gt; We haven&amp;#8217;t yet found someone able to work full-time on Gittip with me, but between everyone else on the team, we have roughly one full-time equivalent. That&amp;#8217;s acceptable while we&amp;#8217;re bootstrapping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If I were to disappear, new leadership would emerge from the community.&lt;/strong&gt; Pretty much the only piece of information the community doesn&amp;#8217;t have that it would need is the password for DNS. Even there, that&amp;#8217;s not an insurmountable problem. Gittip wouldn&amp;#8217;t be the same without me, but it wouldn&amp;#8217;t simply die.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Closed companies need cofounders because they&amp;#8217;re closed. Due to variability pooling, two or three people make better decisions and last longer than one person acting alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Gittip is an &lt;a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/26350459746/the-first-open-company"&gt;open company&lt;/a&gt;, and I&amp;#8217;m emphatically &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; acting alone. The same is true of Gittip&amp;#8217;s open source project cousins: Who cofounded Linux? Or Python? Or Perl? Or PHP? It&amp;#8217;s certainly possible for open entities to have multiple cofounders (FreeBSD, Apache, Subversion, Wikipedia). But it&amp;#8217;s also genuinely possible for the community to be the cofounder, and—whether YC is ready to hear this or not—that is the case with Gittip.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://blog.gittip.com/post/64410217673</link><guid>http://blog.gittip.com/post/64410217673</guid><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2013 15:56:24 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>Drupal Co-maintainer Funded at $475/wk</title><description>&lt;p&gt;While Gittip does not require you to have or meet goals to receive funding, some are defining their dreams and expectations within Gittip and finding success. Recently, the Drupal community banded together to help &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/alexpott/"&gt;Alex Pott&lt;/a&gt; meet a fundraising goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the legal limits, there aren’t any given rules for how to use Gittip: it is a tool. Gittip’s value as a resource is most often visible in direct correlation to the effort and enthusiasm poured into it. It was that energy that allowed Drupal to discover a successful formula for using Gittip: one extremely dedicated worker + a group of committed supporters + Gittip = a reward for a leap of faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six months ago Alex Pott quit his job and began working full time in a volunteer capacity on Drupal 8. A month later he was invited by Drupal co-founder and lead developer &lt;a href="http://buytaert.net/alex-pott"&gt;Dries Buytaert&lt;/a&gt; to become one of Drupal 8’s co-maintainers as they gear up for release. He joined Dries along with the other Drupal 8 core committers Angie Byron (webchick), Nathaniel Catchpole (catch), and Jennifer Hodgdon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex has a history working in Drupal, but he only “met” Gittip a little over a month ago. It seems that the rally to help one of their maintainers meet a goal boosted the entire community. Though the &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/for/drupal/"&gt;Drupal Gittip community&lt;/a&gt; was experiencing steady but modest growth, it is now almost four times larger than it was when Alex announced his Gittip goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In just three to four weeks Alex Pott set and met a goal using Gittip with the help of Drupal supporters. Even investing all the time and money he could, Alex calculated he would need to cover $475 a week. With a little encouragement from others he decided to try Gittip as a means to raise what he needed. Through the following four weeks Drupal supporters not only flocked to Gittip to contribute to Alex Pott’s financial goal, but they spread the word far and wide. The result: Goal Reached. Alex has taken to twitter to thank all the donors and supporters, as well as the Gittip team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex, we thank you. You took a leap of faith with Gittip and with the help of the entire Drupal community made us all a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of hitting $475 weekly on Gittip, Alex has expressed the desire to support another Drupal developer with a funding goal. Keep the momentum going!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow just reached my &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Gittip"&gt;@gittip&lt;/a&gt; goal of $475! Let&amp;#8217;s see if we can get &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/patrickd_drupal"&gt;@patrickd_drupal&lt;/a&gt; his $200 goal because simplytest.me is awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;— Alex Pott (@alexpott)&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gittip is a platform for giving money every week to awesome people and teams. We launched in June, 2012, and we currently have 1,600 weekly active users moving $5,300 per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shields is a great example of an awesome team that should be able to use Gittip for its funding. Having Shields in-house enables Gittip to discover the pain points of, &lt;span&gt;and drive best practices for,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; funding a team on Gittip. (Gittip itself is also funded on Gittip, but that&amp;#8217;s a special case.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is Shields? Shields is an effort to standardize the metadata images that have become common on open-source READMEs over the past couple years. Here is an example from the &lt;a href="https://github.com/rails/rails#code-status"&gt;Ruby on Rails README&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/24c2b64f79dd934f9a72842f852ca1c5/tumblr_inline_ms1v1eDN5a1qz4rgp.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/olivierlacan/"&gt;Olivier Lacan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; started the Shields project in January of 2013, when he grew frustrated with the inconsistency across the status image implementations of various services. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Olivier saw that a professional and consistent design across all of these services would be in the best interest of open-source developers everywhere, so he opened Photoshop and began building PNG images. Joined by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/ackerdev/"&gt;Nicholas Acker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/gittip/shields.io/graphs/contributors"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, PNGs from the Shields project have since been adopted by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/status-images/"&gt;Travis CI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://codeclimate.com/changelog/510d4fde56b102523a0004bf"&gt;Code Climate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.tech-angels.com/post/43141047457/gemnasium-v3-aka-gemnasium"&gt;Gemnasium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Gemfury/status/300709469137010688"&gt;Gemfury&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://coveralls.io/repos/hannesg/uri_template/badge.png?branch=master"&gt;Coveralls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gittip founder Chad Whitacre met Olivier during Heroku&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://waza.heroku.com/"&gt;Waza&lt;/a&gt; conference in February, 2013, and eventually got involved with the Shields project&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://github.com/gittip/shields.io/issues/15"&gt;effort&lt;/a&gt; to build Shields.io, a high-performance, on-demand web service for dynamic metadata images. Shields has clearly demonstrated demand with its static PNGs. Shields.io will make it easy to offer Shields to many more project metadata providers, and will remove the burden of hosting status images from participating providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olivier will continue to manage the Shields.io project within Gittip. The &lt;a href="https://github.com/gittip/shields.io"&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt; has been moved from Olivier&amp;#8217;s GitHub account to the Gittip organization, and has been renamed from &amp;#8220;shields&amp;#8221; to &amp;#8220;shields.io&amp;#8221; to indicate the emphasis on the web service going forward. We&amp;#8217;ve set up a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Shields_io"&gt;Shields_io&lt;/a&gt; Twitter account and a &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/Shields.io/"&gt;Shields.io&lt;/a&gt; team on Gittip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True to our shared love of openness, the agreement for Gittip to acquire Shields was reached over the course of two live-broadcast video conferences (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW_kDoeBEC0"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ0lgVWGSEs"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;), and was submitted for final approval to our respective communities through our issue trackers (&lt;a href="https://github.com/gittip/shields.io/issues/43"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues/1307"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;). Here&amp;#8217;s a screenshot of Chad and Olivier &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ0lgVWGSEs#t=28m01s"&gt;finalizing the deal&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As Olivier &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues/1307#issuecomment-23113774"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &amp;#8220;I believe making Shields a part of Gittip will bring about even more amazing contributions to this project.&amp;#8221; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;We&amp;#8217;re delighted to welcome Shields to Gittip, and we look forward to launching Shields.io and providing even more useful project metadata to the open-source community!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visit &lt;a href="https://github.com/gittip/shields.io"&gt;the repo&lt;/a&gt; to help build Shields.io.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use Gittip to help &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/Shields.io/"&gt;fund the team&lt;/a&gt; behind Shields.io.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://blog.gittip.com/post/59396458675</link><guid>http://blog.gittip.com/post/59396458675</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Aug 2013 10:30:02 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>Open Call with CentUp, Flattr, and Patreon</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/whit537"&gt;Chad Whitacre&lt;/a&gt;, founder of &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/"&gt;Gittip&lt;/a&gt;, will participate in a public video conference call together with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lenkendall"&gt;Len Kendall&lt;/a&gt;, founder of &lt;a href="https://www.centup.org/"&gt;CentUp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bonq"&gt;Linus Olsson&lt;/a&gt;, CEO and co-founder of &lt;a href="http://flattr.com/"&gt;Flattr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jackconte"&gt;Jack Conte&lt;/a&gt;, founder of &lt;a href="http://www.patreon.com/"&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The call will take place on Thursday, May 30 at 11:00 AM US/Pacific (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Sustainable+Crowdfunding+Open+Call&amp;amp;iso=20130530T11&amp;amp;p1=224"&gt;translate to your timezone&lt;/a&gt;). The link to view the live-stream of the call on YouTube via Google Hangouts on Air will be posted on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Gittip"&gt;@Gittip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This call is interesting because CentUp, Flattr, Gittip and Patreon are generally viewed as competitors, each building a platform for sustainable crowd-funding. Gittip is participating in this call because we recognize these companies as kindred spirits in a wider movement. Our individual success depends on a cultural change in attitudes towards giving and value exchange, and we can accelerate this movement by collaborating where we can, and otherwise spurring one another on. We&amp;#8217;re initiating this open communication because we believe it&amp;#8217;s what our users want from us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before and during the call, please ask questions and make comments via Twitter, using the hashtag: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23scfcall&amp;amp;src=typd"&gt;#scfcall&lt;/a&gt; (for &amp;#8220;sustainable crowd-funding call&amp;#8221;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for working with us to build the new digital economy&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s not enough for an isolated individual to join the site, either as a giver or a receiver. They&amp;#8217;ll have a &lt;a href="http://whit537.org/2013/01/disappointed-with-gittip.html"&gt;disappointing experience&lt;/a&gt;. Gittip is a network and it depends on the network effect to be valuable: the more of your friends and colleagues that are on there, the more fun and useful it is.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through historical accident, Gittip&amp;#8217;s growth in its first year has been in the open source software community in general, and in the Python programming language community in particular. There are other communities represented on the site, but because the homepage to date has shown only the top ten givers and receivers on the site as a whole, and because Python was the first community to start using Gittip, it&amp;#8217;s been hard for other communities to see themselves on Gittip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That changes today with the launch of a new &amp;#8220;Communities&amp;#8221; feature on Gittip. Now, self-organizing communities of 150 members or more each get their own homepage on Gittip. Why 150? Because it&amp;#8217;s the&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number"&gt; Dunbar number&lt;/a&gt;, the rough upper limit of the people in a social group that we can each keep track of in our own head. The communities feature is designed to split the Gittip homepage up into multiple homepages, one for each large community or ecosystem. In the coming months we&amp;#8217;ll be introducing additional features on Gittip to better model projects and other smaller groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We actually soft-launched this communities feature two weeks ago, and today the &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/for/korea/"&gt;Korea community&lt;/a&gt; became the first to cross the 150 mark, thanks to a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hongminhee/status/333868284195770368"&gt;call to action&lt;/a&gt; from Hong Minhee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, international credit cards are a rarity in Korea, so the Korea community&amp;#8217;s actual giving and receiving won&amp;#8217;t be very robust until we&amp;#8217;re able to improve Gittip&amp;#8217;s non-U.S. payments story. That said, it was a wonderful surprise today to discover Korea appear out of nowhere on the list of communities on Gittip, and quickly reach the 150 mark. We&amp;#8217;ll get payments sorted out sooner or later, and when we do they&amp;#8217;ll still have been the first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will be the next community to tip into viability on Gittip? That&amp;#8217;s up to you! What communities are you a part of? Go &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/for/"&gt;find or add them on Gittip&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/for/python/"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/for/javascript/"&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; have become the second and third communities on Gittip!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://blog.gittip.com/post/50359120414</link><guid>http://blog.gittip.com/post/50359120414</guid><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2013 15:32:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>New Design, New Team</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/"&gt;Gittip&lt;/a&gt; has a new look, thanks to a collaboration between &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/on/twitter/damon_sf/"&gt;Damon Chin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/nicksergeant/"&gt;Nick Sergeant&lt;/a&gt;, and myself (Chad Whitacre). The site launched seven months ago with a spartan user experience, and early on we &lt;a href="https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues/66"&gt;recognized&lt;/a&gt; the need to do better. Within a month, Damon had contributed design files for a new visual design for the site. Damon is an employee of Gittip’s close partner, &lt;a href="https://www.balancedpayments.com/"&gt;Balanced Payments&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m grateful to both for the contribution. The design languished, however, for lack of someone to implement it in markup and integrate it with our web framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2013, and we’re starting to build the Gittip team in earnest. I announced a month ago that Gittip is hiring, and since then we’ve added over a dozen active contributors working on many different parts of Gittip. We’ve deployed important work from &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/joonas/"&gt;Joonas Bergius&lt;/a&gt; in refactoring the codebase under the hood, as well as smaller contributions from others, but we haven’t had a major user-facing contribution until now&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m grateful to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/nicksergeant/"&gt;Nick Sergeant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for stepping forward to convert Damon’s design into markup. I picked it up from there to integrate the markup with the site itself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refreshing the visual design of Gittip and recruiting contributors were two of five priorities I &lt;a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/33391001893/status-report-and-priorities-for-fall-2012"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; in October. Therefore, with this update, I’m satisfied that we’ve met those two goals. A third, Twitter integration, was finished in November. The two remaining goals from those five are non-U.S. payouts, and integrating with RubyGems.org. I look forward to announcements on those in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/whit537/"&gt;Chad Whitacre&lt;/a&gt; is the founder of Gittip, a platform for inspiring generosity through weekly cash gifts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://blog.gittip.com/post/42849911683</link><guid>http://blog.gittip.com/post/42849911683</guid><pubDate>Mon, 11 Feb 2013 12:08:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><title>Design Gittip</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Design community, I need your help. There’s a stigma associated with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/"&gt;Gittip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that it’s only for open source programmers. To be sure, some of that comes from the name (which we &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/zetaweb/www.gittip.com/issues/138"&gt;tried hard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to change, but which we just need to live with for now). My sense is that the bigger problem is that the visual design that Gittip launched with seven months ago is holding us back from being taken seriously by the design community and by design-conscious communities such as musicians, writers, and artists. This is a bummer because that’s exactly who we want Gittip to work for. I want to support my favorite musicians on Gittip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within weeks of launching we started a &lt;a href="https://github.com/zetaweb/www.gittip.com/issues/66"&gt;ticket&lt;/a&gt; to “change the visual design of Gittip.” It proved to be a fairly popular ticket, and a month later we received a design contribution from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/damon_sf"&gt;Damon Chin&lt;/a&gt; (an employee of Gittip’s payments partner, Balanced). This languished for want of an implementor until last week, when &lt;a href="http://nicksergeant.com/"&gt;Nick Sergeant&lt;/a&gt; stepped forward to convert Damon’s design to markup. That’s definitely going to move the needle for us, and I’m grateful to Damon and Nick for diving in. This post is about how to go even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three weeks ago I announced that &lt;a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/39687487576/gittip-is-hiring"&gt;Gittip is hiring&lt;/a&gt;. This caused some controversy due to the fact that, as an open company, Gittip doesn’t compensate its employees, but the fact is that we now have a dozen people actively contributing to Gittip. This is fantastic! Our bottleneck, though, is front-end expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick’s sweet spot for us is going to be converting design files to markup. Damon’s contribution came through his employer, and, while I &lt;a href="http://whit537.org/2012/12/why-i-love-balanced.html"&gt;love&lt;/a&gt; Balanced, we need to not lean too heavily on them. Gittip needs to build its own team. Therefore, I’m looking for &lt;strong&gt;someone with a passion for web product design to join the Gittip team.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is it we’re building?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Core Product&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a high-level overview of Gittip as a product:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Profiles. &lt;/strong&gt;We enable individuals to tell a story about how they’re making the world better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Giving.&lt;/strong&gt; We enable individuals to participate in each other’s stories through long-term, no-strings-attached, financial gifts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communities.&lt;/strong&gt; We enable communities to tell and sustain a collective story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Extension Points&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the ways Gittip interfaces with other sites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connecting Accounts.&lt;/strong&gt; We support connecting as many other services as possible to a Gittip profile. A few of these other services can also be used to authenticate with Gittip and/or move money into or out of Gittip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Partnerships.&lt;/strong&gt; We seek out partnerships with third parties to add Gittip links in their products. We practice engineering as marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Browser Extension.&lt;/strong&gt; We provide extensions for all major browsers, adding Gittip links on websites with whom we’re not yet partners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Widgets.&lt;/strong&gt; We provide ways for participants to embed Gittip functionality on other websites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;API.&lt;/strong&gt; We provide APIs that enable third parties to build tools for participants to work with their data stored in Gittip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Visual Design Requirements&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the visual design requirements for Gittip as I see them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name:&lt;/strong&gt; “Gittip” (not “GitTip”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motto:&lt;/strong&gt; “Inspiring Generosity”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logo:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/ac566e8621589d231c794020c7b53123/tumblr_inline_mh4b7bbEsY1rn81gb.png"/&gt; (“Heart Coin”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colors:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/2d95cd6ee261fb7d72a98555b92049e7/tumblr_inline_mh4b84OI3O1rn81gb.png"/&gt; (#614C3E) and &lt;img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/135ee65a2f36d361d08b311a561d5dff/tumblr_inline_mh4b8fgua91rn81gb.png"/&gt; (#2A8F79)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Typography&lt;/strong&gt; is open game, but web fonts only (no typography via images).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsive&lt;/strong&gt; design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can use &lt;strong&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/strong&gt; (or another framework) for laying out the grid and handling responsiveness, but &amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to have a &lt;strong&gt;fully customized&lt;/strong&gt; look and feel, including forms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Products I admire greatly: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://stripe.com/"&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.airbnb.com/"&gt;Airbnb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://gumroad.com/"&gt;Gumroad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Information Architecture&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are the pages we have and need for Gittip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;/&lt;/strong&gt; - Homepage focuses on high-level aggregate data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;/about/&lt;/strong&gt; - More charts and other info.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;/%participant_id/&lt;/strong&gt; - Allows individuals and groups to tell their story, connect accounts elsewhere, and manage their giving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;/%participant_id/funds/&lt;/strong&gt; - Allows users to manage “funds.” Think mutual funds; see &lt;a href="https://github.com/zetaweb/www.gittip.com/issues/449#issuecomment-12440694"&gt;this ticket&lt;/a&gt; for a description.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;/communities/%community/&lt;/strong&gt; - Aggregates information about givers, receivers, and funds within a certain community. Community pages are described in &lt;a href="https://github.com/zetaweb/www.gittip.com/issues/496"&gt;this ticket&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;/on/twitter/&lt;/strong&gt;, etc. - Represent accounts on other services that haven’t been connected to a Gittip account (&lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/on/twitter/BarackObama/"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;), or &lt;em&gt;groups&lt;/em&gt; of accounts on other services (&lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/on/github/zetaweb/"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s what we are building, and I believe that Gittip has nothing but open road in front of it. From our &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/about/charts.html"&gt;charts&lt;/a&gt; you can see that we experienced strong early growth, and then hit a rough patch while I transitioned out of my full time job in order to focus on Gittip. Now, here in 2013, we are building a team and are starting to grow again. Our goal is to grow two orders of magnitude over the next 18 months, and to do that we need a strong product designer on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want to join us? You can get in touch with me, Chad Whitacre, as whit537 on &lt;a href="http://dribbble.com/whit537"&gt;Dribbble&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/whit537"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, by email at &lt;a href="mailto:chad@zetaweb.com"&gt;chad@zetaweb.com&lt;/a&gt;, or by phone at +1-412-925-4220. IRC is another great way to connect; we hang out in #gittip on Freenode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you, and I look forward to hearing from you! :^)&lt;/p&gt;

In the first 8 weeks it grew to 151 funders giving $955/wk. Gittip has only added 128 funders and $470/wk in the 23 weeks since, and, in the past 13 weeks, Gittip has only added 6 funders and has lost $117/wk. Interestingly, total users has continued to grow roughly linearly, with bursts in weeks 8 and 16, while funders has flatlined. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="charts" src="http://media.tumblr.com/b07e7046a45a9c0bcdcc04f2957fd2cd/tumblr_inline_mgb9oq8BeF1rn81gb.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/about/charts.html"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m aware of three possible explanations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Gittip has saturated the market.&lt;/strong&gt; Most of the people who are remotely interested in giving money through Gittip are now doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think this is true, because the number of givers on Gittip is really, really small (279) compared to the number of people who, e.g., are on the Internet (2,450,000,000 [&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_Internet_users"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;]). Yes, there will be additional growth when Gittip becomes easier for companies to use, but surely there are more than 279 individuals in the world who “get” Gittip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Gittip has been neglected.&lt;/strong&gt; According to this explanation, the initial burst of growth in weeks 1 through 8 was due to heavy product development and marketing effort, and the slow growth since then is because this effort fell off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is part of what’s going on. I &lt;a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/27072581481/i-believe-in-gittip"&gt;left my job&lt;/a&gt; at YouGov in week 8 in order to pursue Gittip. I spent the next 22 weeks transitioning to a situation where I can sustainably fund my work on Gittip until I’m fully funded on Gittip itself. I worked on Gittip for 29 hrs/wk before I left my job, and 19 hrs/wk after I left my job through the end of 2012. While I was able to &lt;a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/38264311698/gittip-anyone-on-twitter"&gt;finish&lt;/a&gt; Twitter integration during this period, we also got hit with a significant &lt;a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/35314128322/the-delpan-incident"&gt;fraud incident&lt;/a&gt;, which took up a good deal of time without adding direct value to Gittip users. The most glaring result of this neglect is Gittip’s continued &lt;a href="https://github.com/whit537/www.gittip.com/issues/126"&gt;inability&lt;/a&gt; to pay out to people without a U.S. bank account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I spent so little time on Gittip is that I was doing other things: l &lt;a href="http://whit537.org/courses/web-development-101/"&gt;taught&lt;/a&gt; a programming class and I &lt;a href="http://whit537.org/2013/01/humbled-and-excited.html"&gt;took&lt;/a&gt; a philosophy class (these were set in motion before I left my job), I made up for lost time with YouGov, and I searched for new consulting work. Happily, I’ve now made good with YouGov, and we’ve arranged for me to continue as a contractor on an hourly basis. I’m grateful to YouGov, and here in 2013 I’m able to focus on Gittip again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the past three months has made especially clear to me the importance of building a &lt;em&gt;team&lt;/em&gt; to build Gittip. I can’t do this by myself. Therefore, &lt;a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/39687487576/gittip-is-hiring"&gt;Gittip is hiring&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. The $1 threshold is too high.&lt;/strong&gt; In week 8, we upped the minimum tip from 25¢ to $1. The &lt;a href="https://github.com/whit537/www.gittip.com/issues/180#issuecomment-7259749"&gt;thinking&lt;/a&gt; at the time was that this would increase the amount of money flowing through the system. It’s possible, though, that it had the opposite effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to me a plausible explanation for why the number of users has grown consistently since week 8, while growth in the number of funders and the volume of giving has trailed off. New people are showing up on Gittip, signing up, going to leave a tip, and then balking at the price tag. In the long run I expect to implement a &lt;a href="https://github.com/whit537/www.gittip.com/issues/434"&gt;sliding scale&lt;/a&gt;, inspired by Humble Bundle. In the short term, I’m going to run an experiment for the month of January: I&amp;#8217;ve added back the 25¢ tip amount. If you’ve avoided tipping on Gittip because the price tag is too high, this is your invitation to revisit Gittip and &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/"&gt;tip someone who inspires you&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks! :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A Growth Target&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal is to see Gittip grow an order of magnitude in 2013. That is, I want to see us with 1,000 or more funders giving $10,000 per week or more by the end of this year. The average giving per person right now is about $5, so if that holds we would need to see 2,000 funders to reach $10,000 per week. Can we do it? Who &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/"&gt;inspires you&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
