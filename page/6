                    <p><a href="https://www.gittip.com/">Gittip</a>, a platform for <a href="https://www.gittip.com/about/">sustainable crowd-funding</a>, is now just over four months old, having launched on June 1. The core of the service is small, anonymous, weekly gifts to people who do great work.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a snapshot of Gittip&#8217;s current status:</p>
<ul><li>5,780 people have registered with Gittip.</li>
<li>1,773 people (31%) have filled in the blank, “I am making the world better by &#8230;”</li>
<li>341 people (6%) have a working credit card on file with Gittip.</li>
<li><strong>275 people<strong> (5%)</strong> gave money on Gittip today.</strong></li>
<li>40 people gave at least $10 today.</li>
<li>Four people gave at least $50 today.</li>
<li>We’re currently moving over $1,600 per week, and <a href="http://www.gittip.com/about/charts.html">growing</a> 5-10% per week.</li>
<li>30 people (1%) are set up to withdraw money to a bank account.</li>
<li><strong>225 people (4%) received money on Gittip today.</strong></li>
<li>36 people received at least $10 today.</li>
<li>Three people received at least $100 today.</li>
<li>There are 188 open <a href="https://github.com/whit537/www.gittip.com/issues">issues</a>, and 144 closed issues.</li>
<li>15 people have contributed <a href="https://github.com/whit537/www.gittip.com/graphs/contributors">code</a>.</li>
<li>Many people have participated in the Gittip community, via GitHub, Twitter, and Hacker News, and IRC, in particular.</li>
</ul><p>That’s not nothing. I am humbled and excited by the way you all have gotten behind Gittip and used it and broken it and fixed it and constructively criticized it and generally pushed it this far in four months. Thank you!</p>
<p>A couple nights ago over drinks I was telling a friend about Gittip, that multiple patrons on the site are giving away thousands of dollars a year each. He was floored when, in response to a comment of his, I told him it wasn’t even tax-deductible. “That’s amazing that there’s a community that would share that much with each other without even getting a tax break for it!” No kidding!</p>
<h4>Priorities</h4>
<p>Let’s keep flooring people! :-)</p>
<p>We’ve got a lot of pressing <a href="https://github.com/whit537/www.gittip.com/issues">issues</a> with Gittip, and I admit that I can tend to <a href="https://twitter.com/jezdez/status/255589706069319680">get distracted</a> by conversations that maybe aren’t the highest priority. Sorry about that. Stepping back, here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m seeing as Gittip&#8217;s top priorities for the next few months:</p>
<p><strong><strike>Twitter</strike>. Update: </strong><a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/38264311698/gittip-anyone-on-twitter">Finished</a><strong>.</strong> I started adding Twitter support, but it’s half-baked. There’s <a href="https://github.com/whit537/www.gittip.com/issues/289">no way to link</a> both a Twitter account <em>and</em> a GitHub account to the same Gittip account, and if you pledge to an unclaimed account it ends up <a href="https://github.com/whit537/www.gittip.com/issues/309">garbled</a> on your profile. We need to finish baking the Twitter integration.</p>
<p><strong>Non-US Payouts.</strong> We need to find a solution for <a href="https://github.com/whit537/www.gittip.com/issues/126">payouts outside the US</a>. There are 22 people on Gittip who have accumulated $100 or more, and eight of them (36%) are outside the US. There’s a fair bit of pressure to add <a href="https://github.com/whit537/www.gittip.com/issues/14">bitcoin support</a>, which could solve this in theory, but in fact those affected are generally not supporters of bitcoin and wouldn’t take advantage of it. The clearest way forward at this point is probably <a href="https://github.com/whit537/www.gittip.com/issues/63">adding PayPal</a>, or at least implementing a <a href="https://github.com/whit537/www.gittip.com/issues/190">manual process</a>. Maybe we mail monthly checks?</p>
<p><strong><strike>Visual Design</strike>. Update:</strong> <a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/42849911683/new-design-new-team">Finished</a>. Damon Chin from Balanced has contributed <a href="https://github.com/whit537/www.gittip.com/issues/66#issuecomment-7267192">a new visual design</a>, which has yet to be implemented. I think this would make Gittip much more accessible to those further back on the adoption curve, along with giving us a chance to make the site just plain <a href="https://github.com/whit537/www.gittip.com/issues/268">easier to use</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Open Registration.</strong> We’ve got an <a href="https://github.com/whit537/www.gittip.com/issues/223">offer</a> from <a href="http://rubygems.org/">RubyGems</a> to add Gittip integration once we have <a href="https://github.com/whit537/www.gittip.com/issues/89">email-based registration</a>. This would be a great partnership to have in place, and email-based registration would effectively throw Gittip wide open in the process, further expanding our reach.</p>
<p><strong><strike>More Cooks</strike>.</strong> <strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/42849911683/new-design-new-team">We&#8217;re off to a good start</a>. Now, as you may know if you’ve been following along, Gittip is <a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/26350459746/the-first-open-company">funded on Gittip</a>. It’s the only way I could think to do it that is true to the ethos of the site, but that means we can&#8217;t just take venture capital and hire a bunch of people to build this out. I <a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/27072581481/i-believe-in-gittip">left my corporate job</a> two months ago, and have been able to spend about 20 hours per week on Gittip since then. We are seeing some code contributions from others—thank you! Can we do more of that? Do you want to run a Gittip install party at your user group or as part of a Python or other tech conference? I’d love to at least Skype in or otherwise help you out. The more people hacking on Gittip, the better.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of other issues, but those are the ones I am seeing as priorities. Do you agree? What do you want to see Gittip focus on over the next few months? How can I help you build Gittip?</p>

<p><em>This post is by <a href="https://www.gittip.com/freakboy3742/">Russell Keith-Magee</a>, President of the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/">Django Software Foundation</a>.</em></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p class="back-the-stack-photo"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_matzklrNit1rn81gb.jpg"/></p>
<p>From 2008 to 2011, I was extremely lucky. I had an employer&#8212;<a href="http://huntedmedia.com/">Hunted Media</a>&#8212;who not only encouraged my open source contributions, but actively supported them. They sponsored my conference trips, and acknowledged that part of the deal when you hired a prominent open source contributor was giving them the flexibility to spend some of their time working on open source. As a result, I was in a position to make significant contributions to Django 1.0 and 1.1, and to shepherd the Django 1.2 and 1.3 release cycles.</p>
<p>In 2011, I left Hunted Media to pursue my own projects. The biggest casualty of this move was my contribution to Django. My contributions to Django didn&#8217;t wane because I lost interest. I simply couldn&#8217;t affort to spend as much time as I had previously spent working on Django.</p>
<p>This is something I&#8217;d like to change.</p>
<p>One option would be to find another employer like Hunted who would let me contribute to Django as part of my job. However, I think Gittip provides the glimpse of something that has the potential to be much better.</p>
<p>Unless you&#8217;re extremely disciplined, commercial pressures will almost always take precedence over volunteer contributions. If an open source project is managed using resources stitched together from pieces of spare corporate and personal time, it is possible to achieve great things&#8212;the panoply of successful open source projects is proof of that. But if open source projects had the full-time attention of developers, we could achieve so much more.</p>
<p>One way to make this happen would be to call on large corporations to donate to the long term development and maintenance of the open source products they use. However, getting large corporations to donate isn&#8217;t easy. Altruism isn&#8217;t easy to explain on a corporate balance sheet, especially if company funds are already spread thin.</p>
<p>Gittip provides an alternative: Rather than calling for a small number of large donations, it aims to raise a large number of small donations. And instead of trying to convince large corporations to give, it calls on the people who ultimately benefit from the availability of open source&#8212;the community of developers whose professional lives are made better through access to world class, user-modifiable tools, made available at zero cost. If everyone who benefits from open source was to contribute a little bit, we&#8217;d be able to guarantee the full-time support and development of the tools we love, and no one individual would be significantly out of pocket.</p>
<p>My professional career has been made immeasurably better through the availability of free tools like Linux, Apache, mod_wsgi, Python, PostgreSQL, Memcached,&#8230; the list goes on. I hope that in some small way, my volunteered efforts on Django have, in turn, improved the lives of others. I would like to be in a position where the improvement of the tools I love to use isn&#8217;t constrained by the availability of volunteered time; and in turn, I&#8217;d like to be in a position to personally guarantee the future support and development of Django.</p>
<p>For me, Gittip could make it financially viable to make that guarantee&#8212;and do so in a way that is well aligned with the community-driven principles that have made the open source toolchain so great. Open source has always had a bright future, but with community-backed financial resources&#8212;the future could be even brighter.</p>

<p class="back-the-stack-photo"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_maofqsHs4o1rn81gb.jpg"/></p>
<p>Hi, my name is Alex Clark and I am an open source developer. I quit my day job in 2004 to do Plone CMS consulting (Python-based web content management system), and have not looked back. Since then I have organized monthly user group meetings for the Python community in DC, organized an international developer conference in 2008 for the Plone CMS community, formed a non-profit organization to promote the interests of the DC Python community, written a book about the Plone CMS focusing on zc.buildout based development and deployment, and have remained gainfully self-employed.</p>
<p><a href="http://pythonpackages.com/">PythonPackages.com</a> started in October 2011 as a commercial venture to fund all of my open source activities. Since then, it has been featured on Startup Row at PyCon 2012 (thank you, PyCon!), has helped drive the addition of OAuth support to the Python Package Index (hat tip to Richard Jones), and has helped me make dozens of open source Python package releases for the Plone CMS community. I hope it can help others package and release their Python software quickly and easily, in a manner consistent with today&#8217;s fast-paced-development-integration-and-deployment-environment, powered by global leaders like GitHub and Travis CI.</p>
<p>Enter: Gittip. Chad&#8217;s vision for Gittip really speaks to me. All over the world there are thousands of open source developers writing code, managing projects, and moving the world of open source technology forward. This helps millions of individuals, companies and the entire world with a variety of its endeavours. What if those folks could easily show their appreciation to individuals known to make open source happen? What if these volunteer developers didn&#8217;t need to go get &#8220;day jobs&#8221; to make a living because the world has taken care of them? What if companies didn&#8217;t need to hire employees in the traditional sense because their needs have already been met by open source? There is a lot to think about and strive for here, and I&#8217;m really excited to help Chad with his mission. On a daily basis I&#8217;m involved with, and influential to the following open source projects: Plone (Python-based CMS), Pillow (Python Imaging Library fork), Buildout (Python-based build system), and more. I hope Gittip can help me help you, the open source community and the world.</p>

                    (2 years ago) &ndash; <a href='http://blog.gittip.com/post/30116848405/with-payouts-gittip-is-minimally-viable'>Permalink</a></div>
                    
                    
                    <p><a href="https://www.gittip.com/">Gittip</a> is a system for funding people who build free culture. The core is small weekly gifts. The idea is that if 1,000 people give $1 a week to a great programmer, musician, scientist, teacher, etc., then that frees them up to pursue their vision even further for making the world better.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been pulling money into the system for <a href="https://www.gittip.com/about/charts.html">twelve weeks</a>, but until today there was no good way to get money <em>out</em> of the system. There was a <em>bad</em> way, which was me giving you cash from my wallet. I actually did that twice for one Gittip participant, when I ran into him at conferences, for a total of $2.50 withdrawn (followed by manual SQL updates). Then I did make a PayPal donation on <a href="https://twitter.com/whit537/status/223077883554430977">behalf</a> of another participant, for a grand total of $26.80 paid out. But meanwhile we&#8217;re now moving over $1,000 per week, and by this morning we had $5,604.76 escrowed in the system.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pleased to announce that you can now <strong><a href="https://www.gittip.com/bank-account.html">connect a bank account</a></strong> to your Gittip profile. If you wire up a bank account, then Gittip will automatically deposit your money in it each week. If you are set up to give to others, then Gittip will reserve that amount in your Gittip account for the following week, to avoid processing fees. There is a $10 minimum withdrawal, and a 30¢ flat fee on withdrawals. Withdrawals show up on your history page along with gifts to and fro, and any credit card charges.</p>
<p>Gittip works <a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/28351995405/open-partnerships">closely</a> with <a href="https://www.balancedpayments.com/">Balanced Payments</a> as our payment processor. They are responsible for verifying your identity, securely storing your account details, and processing your payments with the credit card and ACH networks. Balanced is designed specifically for marketplaces such as Gittip, and greatly streamlines the process of verifying the identity of &#8220;merchants&#8221; (as the banks would have it) who receive money through the site.</p>
<p>Balanced is US-only for payouts (Balanced and Gittip both support paying <em>in</em> with non-US credit cards). You can voice your interest in support for non-US identity verification and bank accounts on <a href="https://github.com/balanced/balanced-api/issues/23">this Balanced ticket</a> and/or <a href="https://github.com/zetaweb/www.gittip.com/issues/126">this Gittip ticket</a>. In the meantime, I&#8217;m continuing to handle non-US payouts manually. Please contact me, Chad Whitacre, at <a href="mailto:chad@zetaweb.com">chad@zetaweb.com</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/whit537">@whit537</a>, or +1-412-925-4220 to arrange for a PayPal payment or check (you&#8217;ll be responsible for postage/fees at cost).</p>
<p>Nine out of ten US citizens can verify their identity by providing their name, address, phone number, and date of birth. One in ten will need to also provide their Social Security Number to verify their identity.</p>
<p>Two bank accounts were connected for today&#8217;s payday, and $1,147.50 was withdrawn. Withdrawals take one business day to clear the ACH network, so today&#8217;s withdrawals are expected to clear on Monday. We are <a href="https://github.com/zetaweb/www.gittip.com/issues/259">considering</a> running Gittip payday on Thursdays instead of Fridays so that funds are available in recipient bank accounts on Friday (as is customary for payroll in the US, at least).</p>
<p>With this feature, Gittip is now minimally viable. Thanks to Balanced and especially to Balanced employee <a href="https://www.gittip.com/mjallday/">Marshall Jones</a> for contributing the bulk of the payouts integration.</p>
<p>$5,449.41 is currently escrowed in Gittip. If some of that is yours, then go <a href="https://www.gittip.com/bank-account.html">wire up a bank account</a> before Gittip 13 to receive your money!</p>

                    (2 years ago) &ndash; <a href='http://blog.gittip.com/post/29914417845/more-bazaars-and-better'>Permalink</a></div>
                    
                    
                    <p>I&#8217;m teaching a <a href="http://www.whit537.org/courses/web-development-101/">course</a> this Fall entitled <em>Web Development 101: Hacker Theory and Practice</em>, with the <a href="http://saxifrageschool.org/">Saxifrage School</a>. For the theory side of the course, we&#8217;re going to read <em><a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/">The Cathedral and the Bazaar</a></em> (<em>CatB</em>) by Eric Raymond (ESR). I started my programming career in late 1999, soon after the first edition was published (the core essay dates from 1997). The second edition landed in 2001, soon after the dot-com bubble burst. Until reading the book, I actually didn&#8217;t realize the &#8220;open source&#8221; <a href="http://opensource.org/">brand</a> was invented as <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/hacker-revenge/ar01s05.html">late</a> as 1998. I accidentally grew up as a hacker right alongside the open source movement.</p>
<p>I finished reading <em>CatB</em> a couple nights ago, in time for Poul-Henning Kamp&#8217;s ranting <a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2349257">lament</a> for the Cathedral (discussed <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4407188">extensively</a> on Hacker News). I&#8217;m a bit of a PHK fanboy, to be honest, having used FreeBSD and especially <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=jail">jail(8)</a> for my first years as a hacker (now it&#8217;s mostly Mac OS and Heroku). I used his beerware license for some <a href="http://www.zetadev.com/svn/public/svneol/trunk/README">early</a> projects. However, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s smart to fight with reality, and 50% of the population is below average. To me, the transcendent wonder of the bazaar is in including <em>all</em> contributors and <em>all</em> contributions in something bigger than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>I think we need more bazaars, and better ones. We need people with PHK&#8217;s taste to somehow figure out how to organize and direct the energy of the supposedly unwashed masses. I admire Linus for having done this with Linux (<a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/57918">prickly</a> though he might be). I admire Guido for having done this with Python. And to an extent, I admire Jimmy Wales for having done this with Wikipedia.</p>
<h4>Wikipedia</h4>
<p><em>CatB</em> concludes as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p>I expect the open-source movement to have essentially won its point about software within three to five years (that is, by 2003–2005). Once that is accomplished, and the results have been manifest for a while, they will become part of the background culture of non-programmers. At <em>that</em> point it will become more appropriate to try to leverage open-source insights in wider domains.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>I see Wikipedia as the first non-programming open source success. Based on the following <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:EnwikipediaArt.PNG">graph</a> of Wikipedia&#8217;s growth, ESR&#8217;s prediction seems to have been spot on: Wikipedia really started to take off between 2003 and 2005.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m948r6xosz1rn81gb.png"/></p>
<p>Wikipedia is interesting both for what it is&#8212;the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit&#8212;and for how it is managed: <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">openly</a>. Not only can anyone edit Wikipedia, anyone can <a href="http://strategy.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">edit the Wikimedia Foundation</a> itself. That&#8217;s new. That&#8217;s big. It&#8217;s a best-of-both-worlds mashup between a corporation and a government. It&#8217;s nominally a charity, but the 501(c)(3) is a red herring: the preponderance of Wikimedia&#8217;s mass is in the community of people who are <em>not</em> on <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/File:501(c)3_Letter.png">WIKIMEDIA FOUNDATION INC</a>'s payroll.</p>
<p>Now, imagine if Jimmy Wales had Steve Jobs&#8217; taste. Imagine if Wikipedia weren&#8217;t painfully ugly. Imagine if the editing experience were delightful. Yes, there is Project Athena. To be honest, <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Wikimania_-_2012_-_Athena_Project.pdf">early signs</a> (PDF) leave me underwhelmed:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m94ackqwPk1rn81gb.jpg"/></p>
<p>Imagine if the GitHub team were building Wikipedia. The tagging interface would be <em>awesome</em>, if they decided we needed it at all.</p>
<h4>Making Good</h4>
<p>ESR is <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/hacker-revenge/ar01s09.html">prescient</a> here as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p>I believe the problem for 2001 and later is whether we can grow enough to meet (and <em>exceed</em>!) the interface-design quality standard set by the Macintosh, combining that with the virtues of the traditional Unix way.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>However, he turns out to have been too optimistic:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p>As of mid-2000, help may be on the way from the inventors of the Macintosh! Andy Hertzfeld and other members of the original Macintosh design team have formed an open-source company called Eazel with the explicit goal of bringing the Macintosh magic to Linux.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>ESR actually <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/hacker-revenge/ar01s09.html">speculated</a> that Apple itself might &#8220;go open&#8221; with Mac OS X, because in his <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/magic-cauldron/ar01s10.html#id2762774">view</a> &#8220;open-source peer review is the only scalable method for achieving high reliability and quality.&#8221; Well, I daresay that Google and Amazon and Facebook have demonstrated this to be false. These companies depend on open source software, yes. But there is surely a great deal of proprietary work that is essential to their reliability and quality. And far from &#8220;go[ing] open&#8221; with Mac OS, Apple did the opposite. It wrapped FreeBSD in a heavy coat of proprietary code, and captured the lion&#8217;s share of the <a href="http://paulgraham.com/mac.html">hacker laptop</a> market. Ubuntu&#8217;s user experience is nothing compared to Mac OS&#8217;s. Apple then used the iOS variant of Mac OS to basically create the mobile market as we know it <em>ex nihilo</em>, boosting its consumer laptop sales in the process. Meanwhile, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eazel">Eazel</a> folded in 2001, and after a few more years trying to <a href="http://www.osafoundation.org/">make good</a> on ESR&#8217;s vision, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Hertzfeld">Andy Hertzfeld</a> went to Google in 2005, where he remains to this day. ESR&#8217;s poster children are now bywords and also-rans: Netscape, VA Linux, SourceForge, RedHat. Mozilla is basically kept alive by Google, for it&#8217;s own strategic purposes. And then Google went and built Chrome anyway. Sometimes it feels to me like open source is less of a revolutionary than a lapdog.</p>
<p>What happened? Why are our best people building Google and Facebook and GitHub, and not Wikipedia? Or rather: Why aren&#8217;t Google and Facebook and GitHub open projects like Wikipedia? Simple: It&#8217;s not yet economically rational for the world&#8217;s top talent to work on open projects. But I think it could and should be.</p>
<p>If I don&#8217;t like the direction Project Athena is going, I should get involved in the Wikimedia movement and &#8220;edit&#8221; it myself. Right? In a way, I see myself doing that with <a href="https://www.gittip.com/about/">Gittip</a>. I want Gittip to shift the economy towards open projects like Wikipedia. Why? Because I was raised in the bazaar. I love working together as free equals, rather than being someone else&#8217;s cog. Though chains be of gold, they are chains all the same.</p>
<p>Fifty years from now, I want most economic activity to happen in the open. That&#8217;s a dream. I want <a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/26350459746/the-first-open-company">open companies</a>, with open governments to follow.</p>
<p>If you want to see this too, consider joining Gittip, and funding someone who <a href="https://www.gittip.com/on/github/wikimedia/">works on Wikipedia</a>. While you&#8217;re at it, why not fund the people who <a href="https://www.gittip.com/on/github/github/">build GitHub</a>? Would they open up their company, if we made it economically rational? Maybe some of them would even go help out on Wikipedia.</p>
