                We launched in June, 2012 and as of August, 2014 we have
                2,900 active users exchanging $13,000 per week.
                Gittip is funded on Gittip.

                    (1 year ago) &ndash; <a href='http://blog.gittip.com/post/39687487576/gittip-is-hiring'>Permalink</a></div>
                    
                    
                    <p>Building a team is as vital for Gittip as it is for any other company, but Gittip is an <a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/26350459746/the-first-open-company">open company</a>, which means (in part) that Gittip doesn’t compensate its employees. The idea is that people working on Gittip are volunteers who give their work away as a gift. Maybe they receive reciprocal gifts, maybe this happens on Gittip itself, but there’s no guarantee, no salary. This goes for myself, the founder of Gittip, as well. I’m not making a profit on Gittip, only <a href="https://www.gittip.com/whit537/">receiving gifts</a> like everyone else.</p>
<p>Without traditional compensation, the incentives Gittip can offer to employees are rather different. Here are some reasons I can think of to join the Gittip team:</p>
<p><strong>Find a nice living.</strong> While I can’t offer you a salary, I will note that I personally receive about $150 per week in gifts on Gittip. That’s not yet enough to live on in Pittsburgh, USA, but it would go further in Hyderabad, India. At this stage in Gittip’s growth, funding your life via Gittip is a real possibility for someone in the right part of the world. My personal goal is to fully fund my life via Gittip within 18 months.</p>
<p><strong>Learn.</strong> Education is changing, and apprenticeship is in the air. Working on a real web app with experienced programmers would be a great way to learn how to program and start building your reputation.</p>
<p><strong>Support your open source habit.</strong> I had a Skype call with <a href="https://www.gittip.com/zzzeek/">Mike Bayer</a> the other day. He’s the author of the <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> library, which Gittip uses. I realized during our call that I was basically trying to recruit him to be in charge of Gittip’s data layer. If Gittip were a traditional company I would have been offering him a salary and benefits and stock options, but Gittip’s not a traditional company. Instead, what I can offer Mike and others like him is the chance to build a platform that can eventually sustain his work on the project he loves, SQLAlchemy. I’ve got my own favorite open-source project, a web framework called <a href="http://aspen.io/">Aspen</a>. The idea of getting to work freely on Aspen was one of my inspirations for starting Gittip in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>Have fun.</strong> I love Gittip. It’s deeply innovative and it’s got <em>tons</em> of potential and I’m really eager and excited to push it hard. I want you to share my joy. :-)</p>
<p><strong>Work without a boss.</strong> Since you’ll essentially be a volunteer, I’ll never be able to coerce you to do something you don’t want to do. We’ll be partners freely collaborating to build Gittip together.</p>
<p><strong>Change the world.</strong> Startups commonly talk about disrupting industries. Gittip sets the plow even deeper: with the <a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/26350459746/the-first-open-company">open company</a> model, we’ll be disrupting <em>industry itself</em>. That sounds like baloney; I actually believe it. There are some innovative workplaces practicing various forms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_democracy">industrial democracy</a>—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardo_Semler">Semco</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._L._Gore_and_Associates">W.L. Gore &amp; Associates</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondrag%C3%B3n_Cooperative_Corporation">Mondragon</a>, <a href="http://lincolnloop.com/blog/2012/may/31/lincoln-loop-everyone-sets-their-own-salary/">Lincoln Loop</a>, etc. Gittip dials this to eleven. Gittip is the most innovative company on the planet right now. If we pull this off, Gittip is going to have a far-reaching and unpredictable impact on our world.</p>
<h4>Positions Open</h4>
<p>Gittip’s immediate need is for:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Developers.</strong> The stack is Python-based; see the <a href="https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com#readme">README</a>.</li>
<li>Visual and user interface <strong>designers</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Community advocates.</strong> This encompasses both marketing and customer support.</li>
</ul><h4>What “Hired” Means</h4>
<p>“Hired” means we list you on the “About” section of the Gittip website as being part of the Gittip team.</p>
<p>You will have no formal obligations, as discussed above. The informal expectation is that you’ll be spending a good chunk of your life and energy building Gittip. Right now I&#8217;m spending about half my time, for example. If and when you end up lessening your commitment, we’ll simply unlist you from the Gittip website after a discussion with the whole Gittip community. No hard feelings. :-)</p>
<p>Gittip will continue to have a lively community of people occasionally participating in discussions and contributing code. What I&#8217;m looking to do here is build a core team of people working heavily on Gittip.</p>
<h4>How to Apply</h4>
<p>Create a <a href="https://github.com/gittip/humans/issues/new">new issue</a> on GitHub introducing yourself and suggesting that we hire you. We&#8217;ll review these on a rolling basis, and decisions about who to hire and when will be open to the whole Gittip community to participate in. If you have questions first, hit me up at <a href="https://twitter.com/whit537">@whit537</a> on Twitter.</p>
<p>I look forward to your application! :-)</p>

                    (1 year ago) &ndash; <a href='http://blog.gittip.com/post/38264311698/gittip-anyone-on-twitter'>Permalink</a></div>
                    
                    
                    <p><a href="https://www.gittip.com/">Gittip</a> is a platform for sustainable crowd-funding. It allows you to set up a small, anonymous, weekly cash gift to a person who is doing great work. Gittip launched six months ago, and currently has about 550 active users, exchanging about $1,400 per week in gifts. At launch, Gittip required an account on GitHub (a social network for programmers) in order to sign in. Now, it’s also possible to sign in using a Twitter account, and to pledge support to any Twitter account.</p>
<p>This change is important because it significantly expands the number of people that you can pledge support to using Gittip. GitHub is approaching <a href="https://github.com/about/press">3 million</a> total users, and Twitter announced today that they have <a href="https://twitter.com/TonyW/status/281056150651293697">200 million</a> monthly active users.</p>
<p>Giving to someone on Gittip is a way of saying thank you, and also a way to support future work with no strings attached. Now you can use Gittip to pledge support to musicians, artists, writers, activists, organizations and anyone else with a Twitter account whose work you feel is important and inspiring. Here are just a few examples to get you thinking about who inspires you:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.gittip.com/on/twitter/KvonBengtson/">KvonBengtson</a> is pursuing open source space flight.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gittip.com/on/twitter/lisakristine">lisakristine</a> is photo-documenting global slavery.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gittip.com/on/twitter/rstevens/">rstevens</a> is the author of <a href="http://www.dieselsweeties.com/">Diesel Sweeties</a>.</li>
</ul><div>Note that, while you can pledge tips to anyone on Twitter, Gittip never actually collects money on someone’s behalf until they themselves join Gittip.</div>
<p>Once signed in with Twitter or GitHub, you can connect the other kind of account, too. If you accidentally create two Gittip accounts, you can merge them together by connecting both accounts to the same Gittip profile. All tips are moved to the new account.</p>
<p>Requiring an account on one of these networks in order to join Gittip helps to <a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/35314128322/the-delpan-incident">prevent fraud</a>. It also helps with security, because it keeps Gittip out of the business of storing passwords (for now).</p>
<p>Per our <a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/33391001893/status-report-and-priorities-for-fall-2012">roadmap</a> from a couple months ago, the next priorities for Gittip are:</p>
<ul><li>Implementing payouts to non-US bank accounts</li>
<li>Landing a visual design refresh</li>
<li>Partnering with RubyGems.org</li>
<li>Increasing code contributions</li>
</ul><p>Now go find someone awesome in your Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/following">feed</a>, and <a href="https://www.gittip.com/">Gittip</a> them!</p>

                    (1 year ago) &ndash; <a href='http://blog.gittip.com/post/35314128322/the-delpan-incident'>Permalink</a></div>
                    
                    
                    <p><a href="https://www.gittip.com/">Gittip</a> is a platform for sustainable crowd-funding. It allows you to set up small weekly gifts between $1 and $24 to people you believe in. Gittip is about five months old, and currently has about 550 active users, with about $1,500 changing hands per week.</p>
<p>Last week, we determined that <a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/35057426257/stolen-money-on-gittip-part-1">stolen credit cards were being used on Gittip</a>. We started investigating further to understand the nature and extent of the fraud, and we started taking steps to undo it and prevent future fraud. This is part two of that post. I named this incident the <strong>Delpan Incident</strong> after the account we first suspected of fraud, and you can find a <a href="https://www.gittip.com/about/fraud/2012-11-05.html">detailed incident report here</a>.</p>
<p>I conclude that $567.89 of stolen money was injected into Gittip over a period of seven weeks, representing 6% of credit card charges by dollar volume, and 5% by number of transactions. The impact of the fraud is apparent in the following chart, where the weeks in question are shaded red (the Gittip gift exchange takes place every Thursday).</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_md6hnfES1O1rn81gb.png"/></p>
<p>I apologize for this fraud, especially to the original victims of the credit card theft, and to the ten innocent bystanders on Gittip who were affected. I&#8217;m sorry.</p>
<p>I have investigated the network of relationships stemming from the five accounts identified as fraudulent last week (a sixth account turned out to be legitimate). I have also reviewed all accounts that moved money into or out of Gittip in the past, and specifically those that had credit card failures in the past. With help from the fraud and risk officer at <a href="https://www.balancedpayments.com/">Balanced</a> (our payments provider), I looked at account activity on GitHub accounts that were linked to Gittip accounts that also have a bank account attached. My thanks to the employees of Balanced and GitHub who helped out, as well as those anti-fraud professionals who reached out in confidence via email or publicly on Hacker News and GitHub to offer their expertise and support.</p>
<p>We now have an <em>is_suspicious</em> field in the Gittip database, with options “yes”, “no,” and “maybe” (technically, true, false, and null). Accounts start in the “maybe” category. Only accounts where <em>is_suspicious</em> is “no” are allowed to move money from a credit card into Gittip, or from Gittip out to a bank account. Accounts in the “maybe” category may exchange gifts within Gittip, but can’t move money between Gittip and the outside world. Accounts in the “yes” category are not included in Gittip’s weekly gift exchange at all, nor are they permitted to login. Whenever an account first links a credit card or bank account, it goes into a queue and is reviewed before being included in the weekly gift exchange.</p>
<p>As a result of this investigation, a total of 22 accounts have been marked suspicious, out of 6,308 (0.3%). None of these introduced money into the system last week, and, as shown on the above chart, the dollar volume returned to an amount in keeping with Gittip’s normal growth during the past three months. Therefore, I believe that we’ve identified all accounts that have fraudulently participated in the Gittip economy to date, and I have whitelisted all other accounts that have successfully moved money into or out of Gittip in the past. There are currently 431 whitelisted accounts on Gittip (7%).</p>
<p>Here’s a summary of the new categories:</p>
<p><strong>Is suspicious?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yes</strong> - 22 (0.3%) - <em>Can&#8217;t move money at all; can&#8217;t do anything</em></p>
<p><strong>No</strong> - 431 (6.8%) - <em>Can move money; unrestricted</em></p>
<p><strong>Maybe</strong> - 5,855 (92.8%) - <em>Can move money, but only inside Gittip</em></p>
<p>Total - 6,308</p>
<h4>Making Good</h4>
<p>I have refunded the $567.89 of stolen money that was injected into Gittip. I have notified Balanced of the bank accounts linked to suspicious accounts that were used to withdraw $379.80 (67%) of the stolen money, and I am waiting to hear whether they are able to recover any of that money. $104.00 (18%) of the stolen money was given to ten innocent bystanders on Gittip, and will be recovered from those individuals’ existing balances and future gifts. $54.00 (10%) is still escrowed within Gittip, and another $30.09 (5%) went to fees for Balanced and Gittip, whence it will be recovered.</p>
<p>Then, there will be chargebacks. Victims of credit card theft have 120 days to file a “chargeback” for each fraudulent charge, which then takes a month or two to hit the affected merchant, Gittip in this case. Ideally, we’ve identified all of the fraud on Gittip to date, and all stolen money has already been refunded. However, a $15.00 fee applies for each fraudulent transaction that we didn’t refund in time, before the chargeback process began. (Chargebacks remove the moral burden of being complicit in fraud that I expressed concern about in my <a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/35057426257/stolen-money-on-gittip-part-1">prior post</a>.)</p>
<p>I count 29 fraudulent transactions between 2 and 9 weeks ago, so in a worst case scenario Gittip is looking at an additional $435.00 in fees. Assuming in this scenario that the money already withdrawn to bank accounts is unrecoverable, Gittip is looking at a burden of $814.80 for this incident, or about 400% of the approximately $200.00 that Gittip has earned since launching. Ultimately, whatever this burden turns out to be is the responsibility of Zeta Design &amp; Development, LLC, the legal entity behind Gittip, and its owners, namely, me.</p>
<h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
<p>It turns out that Gittip is particularly suited to a certain step in the <a href="http://davepeck.org/2011/11/17/fraudsters-gonna-fraud/">black market for stolen credit card numbers</a>, where low-level agents purchase long lists of numbers and then verify which numbers are actually good by performing small transactions with them. This is often done in the form of small donations to charities that have simple, unsecured, online donation forms. However, the money is lost from the point of view of the fraudster. With Gittip, it is possible to set up a bank account on the other end to recover some of that waste. The upshot is that Gittip is potentially useful for a certain kind of fraud, even though Gittip doesn’t lend itself to quickly unloading large amounts of money from any given card.</p>
<p>Fraud was bound to happen on Gittip sooner or later. Now we know one form it will take. While the amount of bad money injected into Gittip was small this time around—only $567.89—I much prefer to gain experience containing fraud while the stakes are comparatively low than to have been overwhelmed by an even greater degree of fraud now, or to learn an even harder lesson further down the road. Gittip is better prepared for next time, with systems in place that we didn’t have two weeks ago:</p>
<ul><li>A whitelisting policy for transactions with the outside world</li>
<li>The ability to blacklist fraudulent accounts entirely</li>
<li>A fraud dashboard and incident reporting infrastructure</li>
<li>Experience in data mining for fraud detection</li>
<li>A start on communicating additional fraud detection signals to Balanced</li>
<li>Relationships with anti-fraud professionals at partner companies and in the broader tech industry</li>
</ul><p>Morever, this incident has given us a chance to test the principle of “maximizing transparency” that is at the heart of what it means for Gittip to be an <a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/26350459746/the-first-open-company">open company</a>. Rule #0 of anti-fraud is that you never tip your hand in the arms race with fraudsters. Obfuscation and so-called “information asymmetry” are the name of the game. What is the information that is obfuscated? Fraud signals, machine learning algorithms that mine as much data as you can get your hands on to find slight perturbations in the corporate cognitive field, slight disturbances that warn of fraud. It&#8217;s considered a truism that publicizing these algorithms gives fraudsters a much easier time inventing new work-arounds.</p>
<p>I accept the starting-point that fraud will always exist. The task is not to extirpate fraud—that’s impossible. Rather, it’s to keep it to a low enough level for normal life to proceed apace. It’s like insanity. Each of us has a tinge of insanity, but as long as we’re 99.5% normal, nobody notices. I also grant that sociopaths walk among us. Heath Ledger’s Joker has been my mental image during this episode. Why commit fraud? Wrong question. And yet, at this point, my own question is, can I make my fraud algorithms public, and still keep fraud below that 0.5% threshold? Because if I can, I want to. That said, I respect the right of Balanced and Gittip’s other partners to manage fraud on their own traditional, closed terms. There are fairly clear layers here between Gittip and our partners, and I believe Gittip can experiment with openness without jeopardizing the integrity of our partners’ anti-fraud efforts.</p>
<p>I don’t know exactly what this looks like yet, or whether I’ll end up giving up and pursuing an information-asymmetric arms race per the status quo. The <a href="https://www.gittip.com/about/fraud/2012-11-05.html">incident report</a> I published is a first step in exploring how transparent Gittip can be with regard to fraud. I hope to push that envelope further as Gittip grows. Stay tuned &#8230;</p>

                    (1 year ago) &ndash; <a href='http://blog.gittip.com/post/35057426257/stolen-money-on-gittip-part-1'>Permalink</a></div>
                    
                    
                    <p><a href="https://www.gittip.com/">Gittip</a> is a platform for sustainable crowd-funding. It allows you to set up small weekly gifts between $1 and $24 to people you believe in. Gittip is about five months old, and currently has about 550 active users, with $1,400 changing hands per week.</p>
<p>On October 10 (27 days ago), I <a href="https://twitter.com/whit537/status/256125103643963392">noticed</a> a new user named <a href="https://www.gittip.com/delpan/">delpan</a> in the top ten receivers list on the Gittip homepage. This user was suspicious, because the associated GitHub account was recently created, and empty: no repos; no followers, starred, or following; no name or location or avatar. Gittip has grown by word of mouth, so to have a new user unconnected to the rest of the Gittip social graph is unusual. But I didn&#8217;t want to jump to conclusions. There&#8217;s a Counter-Strike player that goes by delpan; maybe Gittip was breaking out into a new community? We <a href="https://github.com/whit537/www.gittip.com/issues/329">adopted</a> a wait and see approach.</p>
<p>Since then, it has become clear that delpan and other accounts on Gittip are in fact being used to steal money. The basic pattern is to create two Gittip accounts, one linked to a stolen credit card, the other to a bank account, with a tip set up from the one to the other. On payday, Gittip pulls the money in from the credit card and deposits it in the bank account. It does this via <a href="https://www.balancedpayments.com/">Balanced</a>, Gittip&#8217;s payment processing <a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/28351995405/open-partnerships">partner</a>.</p>
<p>I have identified six Gittip accounts that I strongly believe are linked to stolen credit cards. I determined this by manually reviewing the top 100 or so givers on Gittip, and looking for patterns. My heuristic boiled down to the following:</p>
<ul><li>The Gittip account is associated with an empty or suspended Twitter or GitHub account.</li>
<li>Tips include significant tips to other Gittip accounts with empty or suspended Twitter or GitHub accounts.</li>
</ul><p>Secondary factors included:</p>
<ul><li>The Gittip account is anonymous on the giver&#8217;s leaderboard.</li>
<li>The &#8220;I am making the world better by &#8230;&#8221; statement is vacuous.</li>
<li>The username is CamelCased.</li>
</ul><p>I have reported these six accounts to Balanced. Together, these accounts have been used to steal $488.15 since September 27. The total charge volume during this six week period was $8,414.92, so the money stolen through these six accounts comprises 6% of Gittip&#8217;s volume during that time. However, we had <a href="https://twitter.com/whit537/status/258939505388707841">an unusual number</a> of credit card failures during the October 18 payday, and unless new stolen cards were associated with the same Gittip account, which I only noticed in one of the six cases, these would not have been reflected in the top 100 at the time I conducted the review. Consequently, I expect that even more stolen money has been funneled through Gittip. I need to do more research to determine how much.</p>
<p>Where is the stolen money now? Again, I need to do more research to fully answer the question. Anecdotally, most has gone to suspicious Gittip accounts, though a significant portion has also gone to legitimate Gittip users. Some remains escrowed within Gittip, some has been regifted, some withdrawn to a bank account&#8212;again, both by suspicious and legitimate Gittip users. Some has been paid to Gittip and Balanced as fees. The ideal is to get the money back to the people it was stolen from. Is this feasible? Do Visa and Mastercard make this possible?</p>
<p>The uncomfortable truth is that Gittip, Balanced, and our legitimate users are financially incentivized to turn a blind eye to fraud, because we have benefitted and are benefitting from it. I have stolen money in my bank account. Heck, I pretty much have stolen money in my pocket right now. The difficulty of unravelling the flow of money once it&#8217;s in the system makes this even less comfortable. We&#8217;re accidentally complicit in the crime, with no easy way to make good.</p>
<h4>What do we do?</h4>
<p>The most important thing is to prevent stolen money from entering the system in the first place. Therefore, I am <a href="https://github.com/whit537/www.gittip.com/issues/356">instituting a whitelist</a>: every giver will be reviewed and approved before Gittip charges their credit card. Gittip has about 350 credit cards on file and is only adding a few each week right now, so for the immediate future I will just manually review all paying accounts before payday each Thursday. I&#8217;ve already started adding admin UI to facilitate this and updating the payday script to enforce it, and no money was charged last week to the six accounts I identified.</p>
<p>As Gittip scales, we&#8217;ll need to rely more on algorithms and less on human intervention, though it&#8217;d be nice to avoid the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=paypal%20nightmare">nightmare scenarios</a> that people run into with PayPal. The fact that Gittip accounts must be linked to a Twitter or GitHub account comes in handy here, and an automated or semi-automated approach based on the heuristic above seems like a good next step.</p>
<p>We still have the problem of recovering stolen money once it has entered the system. I need to do more research to understand what that looks like and what our options are with Balanced before I know how to proceed there, and that&#8217;s why this is Part 1. Stay tuned &#8230;</p>

                    (1 year ago) &ndash; <a href='http://blog.gittip.com/post/34233113773/lets-apply-for-a-shuttleworth-fellowship'>Permalink</a></div>
                    
                    
                    <p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/whit537/www.gittip.com/issues/297#issuecomment-11290946">Denied</a>.</p>
<p>Gittip is <a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/26350459746/the-first-open-company">funded on Gittip</a>. That means the interests of Gittip as a company are perfectly aligned with the interests of Gittip’s users. It also means I can’t take any traditional venture capital to fund the early development of Gittip.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Shuttleworth">Mark Shuttleworth</a> made a fortune during the dot-com boom, and has since established Ubuntu as the preeminent open-source operating system. He also has an eponymous <a href="http://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org/">foundation</a> that gives generous grants to “dynamic leaders who are at the forefront of social change.” A few points in the Shuttleworth Foundation’s <a href="http://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org/about-us/our-philosophy/">philosophy</a> and <a href="http://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org/our-work/fellowship-model/">model</a> jump out at me. First is the focus on people more than projects:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p>We support individuals through fellowships (rather than project funding) because we believe that great people are the true change agents.</p>
<p>We want to give the person with the fresh idea a chance to try it and see if it brings about the positive change they believe it will.</p>
<div>
<p>We hope that by freeing up 100% of a persons time to follow their dream, it will become a reality.</p>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div>
<p>This is, of course, very much in line with Gittip’s <a href="https://www.gittip.com/about/">ethos</a>, as is the theme of <a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/29914417845/more-bazaars-and-better">applying open source models beyond software</a>:</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p>The more we expose the thinking, working and practices of our organisation and our projects, the better.</p>
<p>Working together is faster and smarter than working against each other.</p>
<p>The Foundation does not [&#8230;] fund initiatives with the development or advocacy of free and open source software as the primary objective. We rather apply the free and open source philosophy as the underlying principle to our work.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Lastly, the foundation’s “skin in the game” expectation is something I can certainly get behind, since I <a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/27072581481/i-believe-in-gittip">left a comfortable corporate job to pursue Gittip</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p>We make sure the Fellow invests, both personal resources as well as money into their projects.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>My long-term goal is to find my living on Gittip itself—and if Gittip works for me, it will be because it works for many of us. I think we can get there in a year or two. How do we bootstrap Gittip to that point? It seems that a Shuttleworth Foundation grant would be a big help.</p>
<p>So, in the spirit of openness and community, I would like to invite your input and support as I apply for a Shuttleworth Foundation grant, starting with the application itself. Besides a resume and a five-minute video, <a href="http://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org/funding/fellowship-programme/">the application</a> is just four questions and two pages long:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Describe the world as it is. </strong><em>a description of the status quo and context in which you will be working</em></li>
<li><strong>What change do you want to make? </strong><em>a description of what you want to change about the status quo, in the world, your personal vision for this area</em></li>
<li><strong>What do you want to explore? </strong><em>a description of the innovations or questions you would like to explore during the fellowship year</em></li>
<li><strong>What are you going to do to get there? </strong><em>a description of what you actually plan to do during the year</em></li>
</ol><p>Applications for the spring cohort are due a week from today. I’m going to <a href="http://sync.in/gittip-shuttleworth">draft mine here</a>, and I welcome your input. Let’s show the Shuttleworth Foundation that Gittip is a community worth joining.</p>
