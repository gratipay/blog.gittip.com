                    <p><em><a href="https://www.gittip.com/">Gittip</a> is a community of people building the Commons. This is the first post in a series called &#8220;Back the Stack,&#8221; where we highlight free software developers whom you can support through Gittip.</em></p>
<p><em>This post is by <a href="https://www.gittip.com/stephenmcd/">Stephen McDonald</a>, creator and lead developer of the Mezzanine CMS and Cartridge shopping cart for Django.</em></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p class="back-the-stack-photo"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8r0gdS2GI1rn81gb.jpg"/></p>
<p>Three years ago I started working on <a href="http://mezzanine.jupo.org/">Mezzanine</a> and <a href="http://cartridge.jupo.org/">Cartridge</a>, a CMS and ecommerce combination platform. At that time I was working for a company where we needed something like Mezzanine and Cartridge to standardize our Django development work, and so I was able to spend a significant amount of time working on these projects to support the work my company was doing. </p>
<p>Fast forward to now, and Mezzanine and Cartridge have grown much more popular than I would have ever anticipated, with a wonderful community of developers forming around both projects together. Development has continued every week in some form or another since the projects were first started, but these days with the amount of growth they&#8217;ve received and change of direction around my day job, it&#8217;s often a struggle to find the time, both to support the always-growing community of users, and to continue the development of features to make Mezzanine and Cartridge even better.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never had any expectation around returns on the development of Mezzanine and Cartridge, other than the potential for Feeling Good about creating something amazing that helps other developers out, by making their and their users lives easier - and as I mentioned, this has happened at a level much greater than I would have ever imagined. But as life has changed, and I&#8217;ve found myself with less time available for the growing amount of work needed to continue these projects, I&#8217;ve often dreamt of what it would be like to be able to work on them full time. I think the potential would be amazing, but I&#8217;ve never worked out how that could possibly be funded. Like a lot of people, I have bills to pay and a wife and child to support, so I&#8217;ve never had the opportunity to just drop everything and explore how this might work. <span>To make a living from continuing the development of the free software I&#8217;ve built is my dream, though.</span></p>

                    (2 years ago) &ndash; <a href='http://blog.gittip.com/post/28351995405/open-partnerships'>Permalink</a></div>
                    
                    
                    <p><a href="https://www.gittip.com/">Gittip</a> is a personal funding platform, a way to support people who make the world better by building free culture for the rest of us. We launched eight weeks ago and currently move $950 per week in small, recurring, anonymous gifts. If that sounds interesting you should <a href="https://www.gittip.com/">join the site</a> and support your favorite programmer.</p>
<p>Now something serendipitous is happening with Gittip: we are forming partnerships with third-party vendors in a really unusual way. I&#8217;m calling these &#8220;open partnerships&#8221; because Gittip is an <a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/26350459746/the-first-open-company">open company</a>. Here are the features of Gittip&#8217;s open partnerships:</p>
<ul><li>The need or desire for a third-party vendor to solve a particular problem is raised within the Gittip community, manifesting as a ticket <a href="http://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues">on GitHub</a>.</li>
<li>Vendors who want Gittip&#8217;s business are invited to make their case as equal participants in discussions that are open to the entire community.</li>
<li>Decisions about vendors are made in the same open way as any other decision.</li>
<li>Vendors are responsible to contribute code to Gittip to integrate with their service. </li>
<li>Vendors charge full price for their service. Gittip doesn&#8217;t get some sort of non-profit or open-source discount, because Gittip is not a non-profit nor an open-source project.</li>
</ul><p>Gittip&#8217;s first open partnership is with <a href="http://www.balancedpayments.com/">Balanced Payments</a>, a payment processor for marketplaces. After FeeFighters <a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/25565694263/how-not-to-get-acquired">stranded us</a>, and Stripe reluctantly asked us <a href="https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues/67">to leave</a>, we were casting about for Plan C when Balanced showed up on GitHub and in IRC and volunteered to contribute the <a href="https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/pull/137">code to integrate</a> with their service for charging credit cards. That code went live last week. They&#8217;re currently working on a branch for ACH <a href="https://github.com/mjallday/www.gittip.com/tree/payouts">withdrawals</a>, and have also started contributing <a href="https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues/66#issuecomment-7267192">visual design</a>. The co-founders of the company are YC alumni, so they bring a lot to the table in terms of advice and networking as well. In my view they&#8217;re doing a fantastic job of respecting Gittip as an open community, while making a smart move to acquire what essentially amounts to free business. I keep trying to sniff out whether this relationship is a bad idea, but so far I think it&#8217;s just the good kind of weird.</p>
<p>It appears that things are going to get even <a href="https://twitter.com/balancedpayment/status/230007562752364544">good</a>-<a href="https://twitter.com/dwolla/status/230008364531347456">weirder</a>, because Dwolla now seems interested in <a href="https://github.com/whit537/www.gittip.com/issues/65#issuecomment-7372389">pursuing</a> a similar relationship. <a href="https://www.dwolla.com/">Dwolla</a> intends to displace Visa by moving money for $0.25 per transaction instead of 2.9% + $0.30.</p>
<p>I believe having Dwolla at the table is in the best interest of the Gittip community, and I&#8217;d like to welcome them. :-)</p>
<p>I look forward to deepening our relationship with Balanced. They are the true innovators of open partnerships, having seen the potential and reached out to initiate our relationship.</p>
<p>A third vendor that I would like to invite to the table is <a href="https://bit-pay.com/">bitpay</a>. While controversial, Gittip is getting steady pressure from users to <a href="https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues/14">support bitcoin</a>, and bitpay seems to be the processor of choice.</p>
<p>I would also welcome an overture from <a href="https://spreedlycore.com/">SpreedlyCore</a>, to possibly <a href="https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues/210">vault cards</a> redundantly.</p>
<p>On a related note, I&#8217;d like to thank <a href="http://workforpie.com/">Work For Pie</a>, an alternative to resumes and current job boards, for integrating Gittip buttons with their user profiles. They are even offering to <a href="http://workforpie.posterous.com/why-were-supporting-gittip-12292">match gifts</a> to users that are on both sites:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p>We’re putting our money where our mouth is. Starting now, <a href="http://workforpie.com/" title="Work for Pie" target="_blank">Work for Pie</a> will contribute its own money to Gittip.  We&#8217;re working with the Gittip team to figure out how we can match tips made by others, and once that&#8217;s ready we&#8217;ll be doing so. It’s not much, but it’s our way of saying thank you to all the amazing open source developers out there.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>These are all exciting partnerships! I never imagined two months ago that these sorts of open partnerships would develop. This kind of serendipity tells me that we might be on to something with <a href="https://www.gittip.com/">Gittip</a> and with <a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/26350459746/the-first-open-company">open companies</a>.</p>

                    <p>A number of Gittip funders were charged $10 this week, even though they are only tipping a few dollars or even a few cents (for people who set up tips before <a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/26505682007/is-personal-funding-viable">the tip structure changed</a>). I should have done better to announce the reason for this ahead of time. Sorry about that.</p>
<p>The reason you were charged $10 is to minimize processing fees. You are paying a 3.9% + $0.30 fee each time we pull in money from your credit card, nearly all of which goes to our payment processor. If you&#8217;re only tipping $1.00 then you were being charged $1.36&#8212;a 36% fee. By pulling in $10 at once we only have to charge you a $0.68 fee, which turns out to be 7% of the $9.32 that is actually credited to your Gittip account.</p>
<p>We hope to <a href="https://github.com/whit537/www.gittip.com/issues/65">implement Dwolla</a> to reduce these fees even further, but while getting started we thought it best to implement credit cards first since they&#8217;re much more widely adopted.</p>
<p>The extra money we pulled in this week will be used to fund future gifts. You can see a detailed record of your credit card charges and gifts on the History page linked towards the bottom of <a href="https://www.gittip.com/about/me.html">your profile</a>.</p>

                    <p>I&#8217;m leaving my job, to find a living <a href="https://www.gittip.com/whit537/">on Gittip</a>.</p>
<p>For the past two years I&#8217;ve been a software developer at <a href="http://www.yougov.com/">YouGov</a>, an international company that runs high-end internet surveys. They do statistically rigorous market research for big brands and opinion polling for political scientists. To anyone looking to work remotely writing Python, I absolutely recommend them. It&#8217;s been a great gig. <a href="mailto:chad@zetaweb.com">Email me your resume</a> and I&#8217;ll pass it along.</p>
<p>In some ways, the fact that life was so good at YouGov has made it all the more clear that I need to leave. I couldn&#8217;t imagine simply getting a different job, because YouGov has been a fantastic job. The nagging frustration I&#8217;ve felt is with &#8220;job&#8221; itself as a form of work. I don&#8217;t want to not work. I&#8217;m not lazy. And I refuse to accept that I have to hit a capitalist home run before I can &#8220;do what I <em>really</em> want.&#8221; I want <em>everyone</em> to be free to do what they really want, right now, because I believe that what everyone really wants is to make the world better. Can we unlock the passion? Can we have the stability of corporate jobs, <em>and</em> the freedom of self-direction? That&#8217;s what Gittip is about for me.</p>
<p>Today I released a <a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/27068825269/introducing-personal-funding-goals">feature</a> where Gittip users can specify a personal funding goal. Mine is $2,000.00 per week, and I hope to reach it by this time next year.</p>

<p>In the mean time, I will be looking for about 50 hours a month of contract work to stay afloat, available starting August 15. Please <a href="mailto:chad@zetaweb.com">get in touch</a> if you know of any opportunities.</p>

                    (2 years ago) &ndash; <a href='http://blog.gittip.com/post/27068825269/introducing-personal-funding-goals'>Permalink</a></div>
                    
                    
                    <p><a href="https://www.gittip.com/">Gittip</a> is a platform for personal funding, and so its primary customer is the person receiving money through the site. At the outset here we&#8217;re focused on the nitty gritty of moving money along social network lines&#8212;kind of like if Facebook friend requests had cash attached. The longer-term vision is to help Gittip funders tell a story about how they&#8217;re making the world better. As Kiva has <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/07/the-power-and-the-peril-of-our-crowdfunded-future/259304/">demonstrated</a>, people will pay for &#8220;the feeling of participation in someone else’s story.&#8221;</p>
<p>One part of the story in numbers is the amount that funders are hoping to raise through Gittip. For sites like Kickstarter this is a central feature. Help raise $30,000 in 30 days! Urgency makes those sites tick, but on Gittip we don&#8217;t have that sense of urgency. Gittip is optimized for a slow, steady build-up of a funding base over time. It may be tempting to tweak Gittip to capture more money during short-term spikes in attention, but easy come, easy go. If you&#8217;re finding a living on Gittip then you need your funding stream to be stable, to decay quite slowly. Your mortgage will still be there next month, and your funding stream better be, too.</p>
<p>Today I deployed a new feature that allows Gittip users to specify a &#8220;personal funding goal.&#8221; There are three options for this (the second is the default):</p>
<ul><li>My goal is to receive $________ per week on Gittip.</li>
<li>I’m grateful for tips, but I don’t have a specific funding goal.</li>
<li>I’m not here to receive tips. I’ll generally regift them.</li>
</ul><p>This allows Gittip users to communicate their intention for being on the site, which is a valuable piece of information in deciding whether and how much to give to someone. I know personally that I&#8217;m willing to give more to someone who is truly depending on Gittip. If someone is known to have a comfortable salary, I may toss them a token amount for beer money as a thank you. But the goal with Gittip is not just to give consumers of open source software and other free culture another way to say &#8220;thank you.&#8221; There are enough ways to do that already. Gittip is a new way to find a living.</p>
<p>Of course, what constitutes &#8220;a living&#8221; varies wildly across different parts of the globe. It also varies from person to person, and it&#8217;s usually something we&#8217;re pretty private about. I believe in openness. I believe that we&#8217;re generally mature enough to look at people who are personally funded on Gittip, and accept their own evaluation of what &#8220;fair&#8221; looks like from their point of view. And then we get to vote with our tips.</p>
