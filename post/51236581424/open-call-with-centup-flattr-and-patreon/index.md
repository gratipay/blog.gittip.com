<p><span>This call is interesting because CentUp, Flattr, Gittip and Patreon are
generally viewed as competitors, each building a platform for sustainable crowd-
funding. Gittip is participating in this call because we recognize these
companies as kindred spirits in a wider movement. Our individual success depends
on a cultural change in attitudes towards giving and value exchange, and we can
accelerate this movement by collaborating where we can, and otherwise spurring
one another on. We&#8217;re initiating this open communication because we
believe it&#8217;s what our users want from us.</span></p>

<p>Before and during the call, please ask questions and make comments via
Twitter, using the hashtag: <a href="https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23sc
fcall&amp;src=typd">#scfcall</a> (for &#8220;sustainable crowd-funding
call&#8221;).</p>

<p>Thanks for working with us to build the new digital economy</p>
