<p>We launched our <a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/50359120414/introducing-
communities">Communities</a> feature seven months ago, in May, 2013, to assist
Gittip members in finding—and inspiring—one another. Communities allow
individuals to identify with large groups of people that share common interests,
such as <a href="https://www.gittip.com/for/python/">programming languages</a>
and <a href="https://www.gittip.com/for/korea/">geographical regions</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gittip.com/for/korea/">Korea</a> community group
was the first to surpass the 150-member threshold to become a viable Community,
but other groups have since surpassed it in membership numbers. Viable
communities have formed around <a
href="https://www.gittip.com/for/javascript/">JavaScript</a>, <a
href="https://www.gittip.com/for/python/">Python</a>, and <a
href="https://www.gittip.com/for/open-source/">other tech interests</a> and
projects around the web.</p>

<p>Communities have shown us that they&#8217;re more than just a number of
people with common interests, though. Three months ago, the Drupal Community <a
href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/61497419514/drupal-co-maintainer-funded-
at-475-wk">rallied</a> to help a major Drupal contributor meet a significant
weekly income goal. Community support is integral to the survival of projects
like this. Without it, overhead costs like bandwidth and hosting become cost
prohibitive and a significant financial burden to the project. Without financial
support, many projects like this would not be possible.</p>

<p><span>In fact, a user who joins a community on Gittip is three times as
likely to be an active user of Gittip than one who doesn&#8217;t. Because
it&#8217;s clear that this feature makes Gittip more useful, we look forward to
finding ways of adding even more value to the community experience on
Gittip.</span></p>

<p>There are currently 18 fully active communities on Gittip. Communities with
fewer than 150 members are still considered in the formation stage, but many are
growing quickly. As of December 2013, there are about 700 Communities still in
the formation stage, so there is literally something for everybody. <a

find an interest you share with others.</p>
