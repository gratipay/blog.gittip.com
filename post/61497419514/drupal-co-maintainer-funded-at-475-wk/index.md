<p>While Gittip does not require you to have or meet goals to receive funding,
some are defining their dreams and expectations within Gittip and finding
success. Recently, the Drupal community banded together to help <a
href="https://www.gittip.com/alexpott/">Alex Pott</a> meet a fundraising
goal.</p>

<p>Beyond the legal limits, there aren’t any given rules for how to use
Gittip: it is a tool. Gittip’s value as a resource is most often visible in
direct correlation to the effort and enthusiasm poured into it. It was that
energy that allowed Drupal to discover a successful formula for using Gittip:
one extremely dedicated worker + a group of committed supporters + Gittip = a
reward for a leap of faith.</p>

<p>Six months ago Alex Pott quit his job and began working full time in a
volunteer capacity on Drupal 8. A month later he was invited by Drupal co-
founder and lead developer <a href="http://buytaert.net/alex-pott">Dries
Buytaert</a> to become one of Drupal 8’s co-maintainers as they gear up for
release. He joined Dries along with the other Drupal 8 core committers Angie
Byron (webchick), Nathaniel Catchpole (catch), and Jennifer Hodgdon.</p>

<p>Alex has a history working in Drupal, but he only “met” Gittip a little
over a month ago. It seems that the rally to help one of their maintainers meet
a goal boosted the entire community. Though the <a
href="https://www.gittip.com/for/drupal/">Drupal Gittip community</a> was
experiencing steady but modest growth, it is now almost four times larger than
it was when Alex announced his Gittip goal.</p>

<p>In just three to four weeks Alex Pott set and met a goal using Gittip with
the help of Drupal supporters. Even investing all the time and money he could,
Alex calculated he would need to cover $475 a week. With a little encouragement
from others he decided to try Gittip as a means to raise what he needed. Through
the following four weeks Drupal supporters not only flocked to Gittip to
contribute to Alex Pott’s financial goal, but they spread the word far and
wide. The result: Goal Reached. Alex has taken to twitter to thank all the
donors and supporters, as well as the Gittip team.</p>

<p>Alex, we thank you. You took a leap of faith with Gittip and with the help of
the entire Drupal community made us all a success.</p>

<p>In the wake of hitting $475 weekly on Gittip, Alex has expressed the desire
to support another Drupal developer with a funding goal. Keep the momentum
going!</p>
