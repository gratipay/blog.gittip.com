title: 25&cent; Growth Special

<p>Gittip launched just over six months ago, on June 1, 2012. In the first 8
weeks it grew to 151 funders giving $955/wk. Gittip has only added 128 funders
and $470/wk in the 23 weeks since, and, in the past 13 weeks, Gittip has only
added 6 funders and has lost $117/wk. Interestingly, total users has continued
to grow roughly linearly, with bursts in weeks 8 and 16, while funders has
flatlined. Why?</p>

<p>(<a href="https://www.gittip.com/about/charts.html">source</a>)</p>

<p>I’m aware of three possible explanations:</p>

<p><strong>1. Gittip has saturated the market.</strong> Most of the people who
are remotely interested in giving money through Gittip are now doing so.</p>

<p>I don’t think this is true, because the number of givers on Gittip is
really, really small (279) compared to the number of people who, e.g., are on
the Internet (2,450,000,000 [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_coun
tries_by_number_of_Internet_users">source</a>]). Yes, there will be additional
growth when Gittip becomes easier for companies to use, but surely there are
more than 279 individuals in the world who “get” Gittip.</p>

<p><strong>2. Gittip has been neglected.</strong> According to this
explanation, the initial burst of growth in weeks 1 through 8 was due to heavy
product development and marketing effort, and the slow growth since then is
because this effort fell off.</p>

<p>I think this is part of what’s going on. I <a
href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/27072581481/i-believe-in-gittip">left my
job</a> at YouGov in week 8 in order to pursue Gittip. I spent the next 22
weeks transitioning to a situation where I can sustainably fund my work on
Gittip until I’m fully funded on Gittip itself. I worked on Gittip for 29
hrs/wk before I left my job, and 19 hrs/wk after I left my job through the end
of 2012. While I was able to <a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/38264311698
/gittip-anyone-on-twitter">finish</a> Twitter integration during this period,
we also got hit with a significant <a
href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/35314128322/the-delpan-incident">fraud
incident</a>, which took up a good deal of time without adding direct value to
Gittip users. The most glaring result of this neglect is Gittip’s
continued <a
href="https://github.com/gratipay/gratipay.com/issues/126">inability</a> to
pay out to people without a U.S. bank account.</p>

<p>The reason I spent so little time on Gittip is that I was doing other things:
l <a href="http://whit537.org/courses/web-development-101/">taught</a> a
programming class and I <a href="http://whit537.org/2013/01/humbled-and-
excited.html">took</a> a philosophy class (these were set in motion before I
left my job), I made up for lost time with YouGov, and I searched for new
consulting work. Happily, I’ve now made good with YouGov, and we’ve arranged
for me to continue as a contractor on an hourly basis. I’m grateful to YouGov,
and here in 2013 I’m able to focus on Gittip again.</p>

<p>Moreover, the past three months has made especially clear to me the
importance of building a <em>team</em> to build Gittip. I can’t do this by
myself. Therefore, <a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/39687487576/gittip-is-
hiring">Gittip is hiring</a>.</p>

<p><strong>3. The $1 threshold is too high.</strong> In week 8, we upped the
minimum tip from 25¢ to $1. The <a
href="https://github.com/gratipay/gratipay.com/issues/180#issuecomment-7259749">thinking</a>
at the time was that this would increase the amount of money flowing through
the system. It’s possible, though, that it had the opposite effect.</p>

<p>This seems to me a plausible explanation for why the number of users has
grown consistently since week 8, while growth in the number of funders and the
volume of giving has trailed off. New people are showing up on Gittip, signing
up, going to leave a tip, and then balking at the price tag. In the long run I
expect to implement a <a
href="https://github.com/gratipay/gratipay.com/issues/434">sliding scale</a>,
inspired by Humble Bundle. In the short term, I’m going to run an experiment
for the month of January: I&#8217;ve added back the 25¢ tip amount. If you’ve
avoided tipping on Gittip because the price tag is too high, this is your
invitation to revisit Gittip and <a href="https://www.gittip.com/">tip someone
who inspires you</a>. Thanks! :-)</p><h4>A Growth Target</h4>

<p>My goal is to see Gittip grow an order of magnitude in 2013. That is, I want
to see us with 1,000 or more funders giving $10,000 per week or more by the end
of this year. The average giving per person right now is about $5, so if that
holds we would need to see 2,000 funders to reach $10,000 per week. Can we do
it? Who <a href="https://www.gittip.com/">inspires you</a>?</p><hr>
