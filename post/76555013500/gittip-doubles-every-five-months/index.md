title: Gittip Doubles Every Five Months

<p>Gittip has doubled for the third time in just over a year. On January 3,
2013, we moved $1,425. Using that as the base, here&#8217;s what doubling
means:</p>

<ul>

<li>$1,425</li>

<li>$1,425 x 2 = $2,850</li>

<li>$2,850 x 2 = $5,700</li>

<li>$5,700 x 2 = $11,400</li></ul>

<p>Today, we moved $11,683. That means our dollar volume has doubled three
times in a little over a year. Here are the actual numbers:</p>

<ul>

<li>Week 31 - January 3, 2013 - $1,425</li>

<li>Week 49 - March 9, 2013 - $2,882</li>

<li>Week 66 - September 5, 2013 - $5,769</li>

<li>Week 89 - February 13, 2014 - $11,683</li></ul>

<p>Our number of active users is growing slower than our dollar volume.
This makes sense because we have more companies giving on Gittip than we did a
year ago, and they are generally able to give more than individuals. For
example, <a href="https://blog.andyet.com/2013/11/27/happy-
thanksgiving">&amp;yet announced a program</a> in November (they&#8217;re
currently our top giver), and <a href="https://blog.engineyard.com/2014/gittip-
open-source-grant">Engine Yard stepped forward</a> this past week.</p>

<p>We mark time from week 31 because that&#8217;s when our founder, Chad
Whitacre, started working on Gittip full-time and <a
href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/39687487576/gittip-is-hiring">building a
team</a> in earnest. You can see that growth was relatively stagnant prior to
then, except for an initial burst, and a small bump that turned out to be <a
href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/35314128322/the-delpan-
incident">fraud</a>.</p>

<p>It took 18 weeks for our dollar volume to double once, 17 weeks to double
again, and 23 weeks to double the third time. We chalk up the slight slowdown in
growth to the fact that we released no user-facing updates to the site in the
fourth quarter of 2013. Instead, we focused on technical infrastructure and
team-building. Our <a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/74460469599/with-first-
retreat-gittip-team-becomes-a-reality">Company Retreat in early January</a>
demonstrated the success of our team-building efforts, and marked a return to
user-facing changes.</p>

<p>Since the retreat, we&#8217;ve released the following user-facing
improvements:</p>

<ul>

<li>Ability to connect an OpenStreetMap account, to provide a free-as-in-
speech sign-in option.</li>

<li>Ability to connect a Venmo account, to facilitate one-time, out-of-band
gifts.</li>

<li>Ability to list a bitcoin address, to facilitate one-time, out-of-band
gifts.</li>

<li>Dropped the 150 minimum threshold for Communities, to make it easier to find
people you know on Gittip. Currently the <a
href="https://www.gittip.com/for/perl/">Perl community</a> is <a
href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/peter_rabbitson/2014/02/i-bought-a-weekly-
round-for-my-friends.html">discovering</a> <a href="http://shadow.cat/blog/mark-
keating/2014/04-gittip/">Gittip</a>.</li></ul>

<p>We&#8217;ve also improved our customer support system, as well as
continuing to improve our developer experience. We&#8217;ve soft-launched <a
href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TQATN7-IxphyguJzEqxgo-
99hJYavdOObNYNlVoX0us/edit">a major redesign project</a> to engage the design
community in Gittip and build a truly world-class, user-friendly product.</p>

<p>On average, we&#8217;re doubling our volume every four or five months. If we
continue at this rate, we&#8217;ll hit $22,800 by June or July, and we should
pass $100,000 per week sometime in the spring of 2015.</p>

<p>Thanks for using Gittip, and stay tuned! :-)</p>
