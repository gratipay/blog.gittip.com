<p>Greetings, program! This is a blog for the Gittip gift economy project. You
can read more details on <a href="https://www.gittip.com/about/">the About page
on the site itself</a>, but the basic idea is that it&#8217;s a system for
giving <strong>crowd-funded gifts</strong> to people who make the world better,
so they can make the world better still.</p>

<p>Take <a href="http://ejohn.org/">John Resig</a>. He&#8217;s an open source
programmer and the author of the jQuery JavaScript library, currently working
for Khan Academy. I actually ran into someone at a conference this past weekend
who had just learned about jQuery at the conference(!). Suffice it to say that
guy is late to the party, because pretty much the entire web programming
community depends on jQuery. Imagine if Resig had applied himself to building a
social network instead. And yet, while I&#8217;m sure he draws a nice salary,
he isn&#8217;t a billionaire. What if you could anonymously give John Resig
32¢ a week, just to say thank you? <a
href="https://www.gittip.com/github/jeresig/">Now you can.</a></p>

<p>What if 10,000 of us gave John 32¢ a week? I would <strong>trust him to do
awesome things</strong> with it. <a
href="https://www.gittip.com/github/jeresig/">Wouldn&#8217;t you?</a></p>
