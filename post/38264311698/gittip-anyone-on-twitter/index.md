<p><a href="https://www.gittip.com/">Gittip</a> is a platform for sustainable
crowd-funding. It allows you to set up a small, anonymous, weekly cash gift to a
person who is doing great work. Gittip launched six months ago, and currently
has about 550 active users, exchanging about $1,400 per week in gifts. At
launch, Gittip required an account on GitHub (a social network for programmers)
in order to sign in. Now, it’s also possible to sign in using a Twitter
account, and to pledge support to any Twitter account.</p>

<p>This change is important because it significantly expands the number of
people that you can pledge support to using Gittip. GitHub is approaching <a
href="https://github.com/about/press">3 million</a> total users, and Twitter
announced today that they have <a
href="https://twitter.com/TonyW/status/281056150651293697">200
million</a> monthly active users.</p>

<p>Giving to someone on Gittip is a way of saying thank you, and also a way to
support future work with no strings attached. Now you can use Gittip to pledge
support to musicians, artists, writers, activists, organizations and anyone else
with a Twitter account whose work you feel is important and inspiring. Here are
just a few examples to get you thinking about who inspires you:</p>

<ul>

<li><a
href="https://www.gittip.com/on/twitter/KvonBengtson/">KvonBengtson</a> is
pursuing open source space flight.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.gittip.com/on/twitter/lisakristine">lisakristine</a> is
photo-documenting global slavery.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.gittip.com/on/twitter/rstevens/">rstevens</a> is the
author of <a href="http://www.dieselsweeties.com/">Diesel Sweeties</a>.</li></ul>

<div>Note that, while you can pledge tips to anyone on Twitter, Gittip
never actually collects money on someone’s behalf until they themselves join
Gittip.</div>

<p>Once signed in with Twitter or GitHub, you can connect the other kind of
account, too. If you accidentally create two Gittip accounts, you can merge them
together by connecting both accounts to the same Gittip profile. All tips are
moved to the new account.</p>

<p>Requiring an account on one of these networks in order to join Gittip helps
to <a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/35314128322/the-delpan-
incident">prevent fraud</a>. It also helps with security, because it keeps
Gittip out of the business of storing passwords (for now).</p>

<p>Per our <a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/33391001893/status-report-and-
priorities-for-fall-2012">roadmap</a> from a couple months ago, the next
priorities for Gittip are:</p>

<ul>

<li>Implementing payouts to non-US bank accounts</li>

<li>Landing a visual design refresh</li>

<li>Partnering with RubyGems.org</li>

<li>Increasing code contributions</li></ul>

<p>Now go find someone awesome in your Twitter <a
href="https://twitter.com/following">feed</a>, and <a
href="https://www.gittip.com/">Gittip</a> them!</p><hr>
