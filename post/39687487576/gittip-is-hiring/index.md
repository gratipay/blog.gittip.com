<p>Building a team is as vital for Gittip as it is for any other company, but
Gittip is an <a href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/26350459746/the-first-open-
company">open company</a>, which means (in part) that Gittip doesn’t
compensate its employees. The idea is that people working on Gittip are
volunteers who give their work away as a gift. Maybe they receive reciprocal
gifts, maybe this happens on Gittip itself, but there’s no guarantee, no
salary. This goes for myself, the founder of Gittip, as well. I’m not making a
profit on Gittip, only <a href="https://www.gittip.com/whit537/">receiving
gifts</a> like everyone else.</p>

<p>Without traditional compensation, the incentives Gittip can offer to
employees are rather different. Here are some reasons I can think of to join the
Gittip team:</p>

<p><strong>Find a nice living.</strong> While I can’t offer you a salary, I
will note that I personally receive about $150 per week in gifts on Gittip.
That’s not yet enough to live on in Pittsburgh, USA, but it would go further
in Hyderabad, India. At this stage in Gittip’s growth, funding your life via
Gittip is a real possibility for someone in the right part of the world. My
personal goal is to fully fund my life via Gittip within 18 months.</p>

<p><strong>Learn.</strong> Education is changing, and apprenticeship is in the
air. Working on a real web app with experienced programmers would be a great way
to learn how to program and start building your reputation.</p>

<p><strong>Support your open source habit.</strong> I had a Skype call with <a
href="https://www.gittip.com/zzzeek/">Mike Bayer</a> the other day. He’s the
author of the <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> library, which
Gittip uses. I realized during our call that I was basically trying to recruit
him to be in charge of Gittip’s data layer. If Gittip were a traditional
company I would have been offering him a salary and benefits and stock options,
but Gittip’s not a traditional company. Instead, what I can offer Mike and
others like him is the chance to build a platform that can eventually sustain
his work on the project he loves, SQLAlchemy. I’ve got my own favorite open-
source project, a web framework called <a href="http://aspen.io/">Aspen</a>. The
idea of getting to work freely on Aspen was one of my inspirations for starting
Gittip in the first place.</p>

<p><strong>Have fun.</strong> I love Gittip. It’s deeply innovative and it’s
got <em>tons</em> of potential and I’m really eager and excited to push it
hard. I want you to share my joy. :-)</p>

<p><strong>Work without a boss.</strong> Since you’ll essentially be a
volunteer, I’ll never be able to coerce you to do something you don’t want
to do. We’ll be partners freely collaborating to build Gittip together.</p>

<p><strong>Change the world.</strong> Startups commonly talk about disrupting
industries. Gittip sets the plow even deeper: with the <a
href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/26350459746/the-first-open-company">open
company</a> model, we’ll be disrupting <em>industry itself</em>. That sounds
like baloney; I actually believe it. There are some innovative workplaces
practicing various forms of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_democracy">industrial
democracy</a>—<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardo_Semler">Semco</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._L._Gore_and_Associates">W.L. Gore &amp;
Associates</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondrag%C3%B3n_Cooperativ
e_Corporation">Mondragon</a>, <a href="http://lincolnloop.com/blog/2012/may/31
/lincoln-loop-everyone-sets-their-own-salary/">Lincoln Loop</a>, etc. Gittip
dials this to eleven. Gittip is the most innovative company on the planet right
now. If we pull this off, Gittip is going to have a far-reaching and
unpredictable impact on our world.</p><h4>Positions Open</h4>

<p>Gittip’s immediate need is for:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Developers.</strong> The stack is Python-based; see the <a
href="https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com#readme">README</a>.</li>

<li>Visual and user interface <strong>designers</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Community advocates.</strong> This encompasses both marketing and
customer support.</li></ul><h4>What “Hired” Means</h4>

<p>“Hired” means we list you on the “About” section of the Gittip
website as being part of the Gittip team.</p>

<p>You will have no formal obligations, as discussed above. The informal
expectation is that you’ll be spending a good chunk of your life and energy
building Gittip. Right now I&#8217;m spending about half my time, for example.
If and when you end up lessening your commitment, we’ll simply unlist you from
the Gittip website after a discussion with the whole Gittip community. No hard
feelings. :-)</p>

<p>Gittip will continue to have a lively community of people occasionally
participating in discussions and contributing code. What I&#8217;m looking to do
here is build a core team of people working heavily on Gittip.</p><h4>How to Apply</h4>

<p>Create a <a href="https://github.com/gittip/humans/issues/new">new issue</a>
on GitHub introducing yourself and suggesting that we hire you. We&#8217;ll
review these on a rolling basis, and decisions about who to hire and when will
be open to the whole Gittip community to participate in. If you have questions
first, hit me up at <a href="https://twitter.com/whit537">@whit537</a> on
Twitter.</p>

<p>I look forward to your application! :-)</p><hr>
