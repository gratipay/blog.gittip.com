<p>In “<a href="https://medium.com/building-gittip/gittip-year-two-
a220308d4ec9">Gittip, Year Two</a>,” I concluded that Gittip works, but not
yet for Gittip. We know that it’s possible to use Gittip to make a sustainable
living. We know that Gittip can enable amazing work. The question is, can we
sustain Gittip itself through voluntary payments from our users? Can we fund
Gittip on Gittip? So far the answer is, “No.” Gittip makes about <a
href="https://www.gittip.com/Gittip/">$470 per week</a>, which is about $2,000
per month, or $24,000 per year. We are not a sustainable business.</p>

<p>Wikipedia is the best example of an organization that successfully funds
itself by asking its users to voluntarily pay for the service, through their
familiar annual fundraiser. Taking a cue from them, we’ve added a Wikipedia-
style appeal to Gittip. Here’s what it looks like:</p>

<p>We show this message to active users of Gittip who don’t give to Gittip.
You won’t see it otherwise. The specific dollar amounts are scoped to your
usage of the platform; our suggestions are also reflected on our new <a
href="https://www.gittip.com/about/pricing">Pricing</a> page. Feel free to
choose a different amount, or to opt out if you prefer.</p>

<p>We hope to encourage active users to pay for using Gittip, so that we can
survive and thrive as an open company. If we can figure out the formula for
ourselves, then we can help other <a href="http://www.opencompany.org/">open
companies</a> building <a href="http://thechangelog.com/open-products/">open
products</a> to be funded along the same lines. Eventually, we want Gittip to be
a place you can go to find a whole range of open companies to work for and make
a living from. Our mission is to enable an economy based on gratitude,
generosity, and love, where we all share our work and wealth and lives with each
other voluntarily and abundantly. From what I can tell so far, it&#8217;s really
fun! :D</p>

<p>Will you <a href="https://www.gittip.com/Gittip/">help us</a>?</p>
